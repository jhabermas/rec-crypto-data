But...\n\n1. what percentage of these inflows are people moving money from spot Bitcoin to the Bitcoin ETFs?\n2. how do we account for the people who planned on buying Bitcoin (spot) but instead are now purchasing Bitcoin ETFs.  For example, let's say that you are a Bitcoin whale and have bought like 100 million dollars worth of Bitcoin every year.  Now, instead of buying spot Bitcoin, you buy Bitcoin ETF.  I would argue that nothing has changed pre-ETF vs post-ETF with regards to this Bitcoin whale but just on paper, it looks like there is more buying pressure (but in reality, there isn't more buying pressure).\n3. This is not to say Bitcoin ETF is a negative, but its effect (by just analyzing the net inflow) is incomplete and can be vastly misleading.\n4. On the other hand, the supply shock from the halving is net decrease in the supply and there is nothing else to argue against that point.  So this is truly a bullish event.",
