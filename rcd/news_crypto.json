This was during a call with analysts following the company‚Äôs fiscal Q1 earnings report on Thursday.\nCook stated that the company will continue to invest in technologies that will shape the future.\n‚ÄúThat includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we‚Äôre excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,‚Äù he said refraining from giving more details about the tech titan‚Äôs AI plans. ‚ÄúLet me just say that I think there‚Äôs a huge opportunity for Apple with generative AI and with AI, without getting into many more details or getting out ahead of myself.‚Äù\nThis comes on the heels of reports that the next version of its iPhone software ‚Äì iOS 18 ‚Äì set to be announced later in the year, could be one of the operating system‚Äôs biggest updates yet.\nFollowing the success of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon jumped on the generative AI bandwagon, beginning work on generative AI models. Just this week, Apple‚Äôs rival Samsung released its Galaxy S24 series featuring generative AI capabilities such as translation, transcription, and photo editing.\nWhile Apple has yet to announce any work on a gen AI model, it has been using machine learning technology in its chips and software for features such as image recognition.\nAt its annual Worldwide Developer Conference last year, the company announced an iPhone keyboard upgrade that incorporated a transformer-based language model, similar to the technology behind GPT, for smarter autocorrection capabilities.\nMeanwhile, Apple‚Äôs revenue and earnings beat analyst estimates despite a 13% decline in China, one of its most important markets.¬† The company reported quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2% from the same period last year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.18, up 16% year-over-year.\nApple also reported a gross margin of nearly 46% for the December quarter, representing a continued upward trend. The company‚Äôs net income also increased by 13% year-over-year, reaching $33.92 billion.\nThe company‚Äôs number of active devices increased from 2 billion at the same time the previous year to 2.2 billion in 2023.\n‚ÄúWe are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments [‚Ä¶] We are committed as ever to the pursuit of groundbreaking innovation ‚Äì in line with our values and on behalf of our customers,‚Äù Cook stated.\nFurther, Apple‚Äôs board of directors approved a $0.24 per share cash dividend, ‚Äúpayable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 12, 2024.‚Äù\nnextApple CEO Tim Cook Hints at AI Announcement ‚ÄòLater This Year‚Äô",

Both funds charge a sponsors‚Äô fee of 0.25% compared to GBTC‚Äôs 1.5%.

Its approach is bearing fruits.\nGBTC‚Äôs overall BTC holding has since tanked below 500K as of press time.

Ark 21Shares BTC ETF (ARKB) and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) followed closely with a total of +30K BTC in holding.\nCollectively, the spot BTC ETFs market cap hit a new high of $29.7 billion on 2 February as BTC recovered slightly after the US Fed‚Äôs rate decision. The king coin was up 0.97% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinmarketCap data. It is exchanging hands at $42.6K.\nIn the meantime, Glassnode, a data intelligence platform, noted that the strong BTC capital inflows and recent supply overhang from GBTC trades had delayed a much-expected BTC price acceleration to its all-time high.

        "content": "Coinspeaker\nCelsius Mining Assets Find New Life as Ionic Digital Gears Up for Takeover and IPO\nCelsius, a company that deals with cryptocurrency lending, declared bankruptcy in 2022. However, its Bitcoin mining business is getting a second chance. The company is selling its mining assets to Ionic Digital, a company that wants to become a top Bitcoin miner in North America and go public.\nIonic Digital plans to restart Celsius‚Äô self-mining capacity of 87 megawatts (MW) and the hosted mining capacity of 142 MW spread across different sites. The purchase also includes Celsius‚Äô Cedarvale site, which is still being developed but is expected to support 240 MW.\nBy acquiring all of Celsius‚Äô mining equipment and infrastructure, Ionic Digital believes it can quickly reach its goal of total mining power of 12.7 exahash per second (EH/s) later this year. Currently, the company mines Bitcoin at a rate of 6 EH/s. In commenting on the development, the company said:\n‚ÄúOur team is well-prepared to deal with the growing competition in mining, using our flexibility and strong financial backing to our advantage.‚Äù\nTo prepare for its expansion plans, they have filed Form 10 with the SEC, an important step towards going public. This follows the creditors of bankrupt Celsius becoming shareholders in Ionic Digital.\nIonic Digital is not alone in its pursuit of going public. Other bitcoin miners, like Swan Bitcoin, have also announced plans to go public within the next year. It is likely that more miners will follow their lead and file with the SEC.\nPartnering with Hut 8 to Bolster Mining Operations\nTo strengthen its mining operations, Ionic Digital has formed a strategic partnership with Hut 8 Mining. Hut 8 will provide management services for its mining operations in exchange for an annual fee of $20 million.\nAs part of the deal, Hut 8 will also receive equity in Ionic Digital in the form of restricted stock and incentive shares. Matt Prusak, the former Chief Commercial Officer of Hut 8, will be the CEO of Ionic Digital, and Asher Genoot, the President of Hut 8, will join Ionic‚Äôs Board of Directors.\nWith the consolidation of Celsius‚Äô mining assets under Ionic Digital and the addition of experienced industry veterans, the ambitious startup believes it can thrive even in the face of growing competition in the Bitcoin mining industry.\nIonic Digital highlights its adaptable leadership, strong financial support through its plans to go public, and its technical infrastructure as advantages over its rivals. The executive team and investors are confident in the potential of large-scale mining, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and the growth of the network.\nAs the race to increase mining capacity becomes more intense, Ionic Digital is an example of mining companies urgently expanding before the halving event changes the economics once again. By taking over from Celsius and becoming a publicly-listed mining leader, they have high hopes of becoming a major provider for the growing Bitcoin network.\nnextCelsius Mining Assets Find New Life as Ionic Digital Gears Up for Takeover and IPO",

According to the company, it raised $8 million in the just-concluded round, which saw participation from major investors like Animoca Brands, Delphi Ventures, Amber Group, Bing Ventures, Bitscale Capital, Cypher Capital, and many others.\nHow Pixelmon Fell from Grace\nIt might be noteworthy that Pixelmon launched in February 2022 in what many thought was a wrong start. During its early days, the Web 3.0 project quickly sold 10,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs), raking in a massive amount of cryptocurrency (about $70 million at the time) in the process.\nMany individuals with vested interests in Pixelmon immediately saw that revenue as a good enough amount of funds to float a triple-A video game. However, the project could not live up to expectations.\nUsers were more than shocked when it came out with one badly made art that led to a vast majority of them losing trust in the project. There were also rumors of mismanagement of funds. While some called Pixelmon a scam, others started pointing accusing fingers at its relatively young founder, Syber, saying he may have orchestrated a rug pull.\nRoad to Recovery\nPixelmon began to find its footing some months later when LiquidX, a Singapore-based Web 3.0 venture capital studio assumed control of it. The angel investor acquired the firm in a deal worth about $40 million. This meant that LiquidX had 60% control of Pixelmon, while Syber became a minority shareholder.\nThe takeover also saw a complete overhaul of the team, as LiquidX‚Äôs co-founder Giulio Xiloyannis became CEO of the gaming firm.\nXiloyannis set out a recovery roadmap and by October 2023, the firm launched Kevin the Adventurer, its first hypercasual game. Per the company, that title saw 36,000 active players, garnering over 10,000 hours of gameplay during its first month.\nFrom all indications, Pixelmon appears to be well on its path to recovery. More so, given the support it has received from other credible Web3.0 projects that partook in the latest seed round.\nAccording to the CEO, the firm has been working in silence for the better part of the past months. Although it was actively recruiting industry leaders, the firm did not see a need to make any noise about its acclaimed redemption until there were results to show for it.\nNow, however, it appears that his confidence levels are up when he said that ‚Äúthe project has a certain past, but it‚Äôs truly turning around on that‚Äù.\nnextPixelmon Completes $8M Seed Round to Boost Web 3.0 Game Goals",

Velar aims to gradually challenge Ethereum‚Äôs status as the premium Layer 1 (L1) for DeFi, paving the way for financial dApps to thrive on the Bitcoin network.\nWhile initially launching on Stacks, Velar is designed as a Layer 2 (L2)-agnostic protocol, indicating its flexibility to integrate with other leading Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions. The platform was co-founded by Mithil Thakore, Jakob, Tejinder Singh Mor, and Aravind Sathyanandham, all fintech and blockchain veterans with extensive experience in the Web3 space.

The stock is now trading at levels similar to those observed in March 2023.¬† NYCB has reported major stress on its real-estate portfolio rekindling concerns across the banking space.\nThe intense selling pressure in banking shares has revived concerns about regional lenders, despite assertions from analysts and investors that the challenges faced by NYCB are largely unique. Moreover, Alexander Yokum, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, notes that NYCB‚Äôs exposure to real estate is much higher than its peers. Speaking to CNBC, Yokum said:\n‚ÄúLast year was definitely the year of deposits. No bank wanted to be in a position where they were seeing deposit outflows. This year, the story changes to credit quality.‚Äù\nMoody‚Äôs has placed NYCB‚Äôs ratings under review for a potential downgrade, which might lead it into ‚Äújunk territory‚Äù.

The downturn in these bank stocks coincided with significant market movements. This provided an opportunity for short sellers to capitalize on the negative trend.\nNYCB‚Äôs acquisition of Signature Bank, coupled with its purchase of Flagstar Bank in 2022, elevated its assets beyond the $100 billion regulatory threshold. This threshold triggers more stringent capital and liquidity requirements for the bank. Analysts from Jefferies noted:\n‚ÄúWe believe NYCB has several idiosyncratic characteristics, but the result and reaction are reminders of risks that remain in the regional banking space.‚Äù\nAnalysts suggest that banks offering elevated interest rates on deposits may experience a decline in their NII (net interest income), representing the difference between earnings from loans and payments on deposits. In the first-quarter earnings reports, numerous regional banks indicated a declining NII.\nRegional banks could face additional challenges, including exposure to the troubled commercial real estate (CRE) sector.

        "summary": "Understanding the challenges of crypto after death is vital for anyone investing in digital assets. Without proper preparation, your digital wealth could become inaccessible after your passing. This guide aims to navigate the complexities of managing cryptocurrencies after death. It covers essential steps, from documenting holdings to navigating legal considerations, ensuring your digital legacy is secure and your loved ones are taken care of. The Importance Of Planning For Crypto After Death In the realm of crypto, your investments don‚Äôt automatically transfer to your next of kin upon your demise. The absence of traditional banking or legal structures in the crypto world means the responsibility of managing and passing on your assets falls entirely on you. Planning becomes essential to ensure that your crypto holdings do not get locked away in the digital world, but instead, serve as a valuable part of your legacy. Proper planning not only secures your assets but also simplifies the process for your beneficiaries. It mitigates the risk of loss due to forgotten passwords or keys and prevents potential legal hurdles that your loved ones might face. As the crypto market continues to mature, understanding and preparing for the implications of crypto after death becomes increasingly crucial. Understanding The Unique Challenges Of Cryptocurrencies After Death Navigating the unique challenges of crypto after death is crucial for effective estate planning. Cryptocurrencies operate on technology that inherently promotes anonymity and security. While these features are advantageous for protecting your assets during your lifetime, they pose significant challenges after death. The absence of a central authority like a bank means there is no straightforward process to claim or transfer assets. Accessing cryptocurrencies after death requires knowledge of private keys or seed phrases, which are often known only to the asset holder. Without proper planning and communication, these crucial pieces of information might never reach the intended beneficiaries, leading to permanent loss of the assets. Additionally, the legal landscape surrounding digital assets is still evolving, which adds another layer of complexity to managing crypto after death. Recognizing these challenges represents the initial step toward crafting a robust plan to ensure your digital assets are passed on as intended, streamlining the process for your loved ones as much as possible. How To Pass On Your Crypto After Death Understanding how to pass on your crypto after death ensures that your investments continue to benefit your loved ones, aligning with your wishes and intentions. This section outlines the essential steps you need to take to prepare your digital estate, focusing on documentation, secure information sharing, and the mechanisms to ensure a smooth transition of your assets. Essential Steps Inventory Of Assets: Begin by compiling a comprehensive list of your cryptocurrencies, including wallet addresses, balances, and the platforms where they are stored. Instructions For Access: Provide detailed instructions on how to access your wallets, including hardware devices or any specific software needed. Legal Documentation: Consult with a legal professional to integrate your digital assets into your estate planning. This includes wills, trusts, or any other relevant legal documents that ensure your crypto assets are recognized and managed as part of your estate. Backup And Security: Make sure to securely back up all information pertaining to your crypto holdings, including access instructions and legal documents, in a manner that allows your executor or beneficiaries to access it when needed. Documenting Your Crypto Holdings Documenting your crypto holdings thoroughly is the cornerstone of ensuring they can be successfully passed on. This documentation should include: List Of Assets: List all the cryptocurrencies you own, their respective amounts, and specify the wallets or exchanges where they are held. Access Details: Wallet addresses, private keys, seed phrases, and any other information necessary to access and manage the cryptocurrencies. Transaction Records: Records of transactions, purchases, or sales, which can be crucial for tax purposes or for tracking the evolution of your portfolio. Regularly update and securely store this documentation in a manner that remains accessible to those entrusted with managing your estate. Securely Sharing Access Information Securely sharing access information is delicate but essential. Consider the following: Physical Storage: Use a safety deposit box or a secure home safe for storing hardware wallets and paper records of your access information. Digital Security: If you store information digitally, use encryption and secure backups. Ensure your beneficiaries know how to access and decrypt these files if necessary. Best Practices For Storing Private Keys And Passphrases Redundancy: Store your private keys and seed phrases in multiple secure locations. Avoid Digital Copies: If possible, avoid storing your private keys or seed phrases on internet-connected devices. The Role Of Multi-Signature Wallets In Managing Crypto After Death Consider setting up a multi-signature wallet that requires multiple approvals for transactions. This can provide an additional layer of security and a clear pathway for your beneficiaries to access the funds with the right set of keys. Legal Considerations for Cryptocurrencies After Death Addressing the legal considerations for cryptocurrencies after death is crucial to ensure that your digital assets are transferred according to your wishes and in compliance with the law. As the legal framework for digital assets continues to evolve, understanding how to navigate this landscape is key. How To Incorporate Crypto Assets In Your Will Incorporating crypto assets into your will requires careful planning and precision. Consider these steps: Specify Your Assets: Clearly list all your crypto assets in your will. Include details like wallet addresses and the types of cryptocurrencies you own. Access Instructions: Rather than including sensitive access information directly in your will (which becomes a public document upon death), use a letter of instruction or a similar private document to provide detailed access instructions. Choose Your Beneficiaries: Specify who inherits each portion of your crypto assets. Be as clear and unambiguous as possible. Select An Executor: Choose an executor who is not only trustworthy but also has or is willing to gain a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies and how to handle them. Consult Legal Professionals: Work with attorneys who have expertise in estate planning and a solid understanding of digital assets. They can help ensure that your will complies with current laws and effectively encompasses your crypto holdings. Navigating Inheritance Laws And Cryptocurrencies Navigating inheritance laws in the context of cryptocurrencies can be complex due to the relatively new and evolving nature of these digital assets. Consider these factors: Legal Status Of Cryptocurrencies: Gain an understanding of how your local jurisdiction classifies cryptocurrencies ‚Äì as property, currency, or something else ‚Äì as this classification can impact how they treat these assets in the context of inheritance. Taxes: Be aware of potential tax implications for your heirs. In some jurisdictions, inheriting cryptocurrencies can trigger tax events like inheritance tax or capital gains tax upon their eventual sale. International Considerations: If your crypto assets reside in wallets or exchanges located in different countries, international laws and regulations may come into play, potentially complicating the inheritance process. Updating Estate Plans: The legal landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is still in flux. Regularly review and update your estate planning documents to accommodate new laws and regulations. By addressing these legal considerations and preparing thoroughly, you can ensure that your cryptocurrencies are managed after your death as you intended. This provides clear guidance to your loved ones and reduces the potential for legal complications. Technological Solutions To Ensure Safe Transfer Of Your Crypto After Death The following solutions aim to address the unique challenges posed by the digital nature of cryptocurrencies, ensuring a smooth and secure transfer of your assets. Consider the following technological strategies: Smart Contracts: Utilize smart contracts on blockchain platforms to automate the transfer of assets upon meeting certain conditions, such as verifying death. This ensures a direct and automatic transfer to your beneficiaries, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Multi-Signature Wallets: Implement multi-signature wallets that require multiple keys to authorize transactions. Allocate one key to your beneficiary and another to a trusted third party or attorney, ensuring that your assets can only be accessed after your death. Dead Man‚Äôs Switch: Consider services or programmable arrangements that automatically release your crypto assets if you fail to perform certain actions within a specified period, indicating potential incapacitation or death. Encrypted Backup Solutions: Use encrypted backup solutions to store access information securely. Ensure that your beneficiaries have a way to decrypt the information when needed, without compromising security during your lifetime. Cold Wallets: Utilize hardware wallets like Trezor or BitBox02 for storing cryptocurrencies. These cold wallets keep your assets offline and secure from online threats. You can physically hand them over to your chosen heirs, along with instructions for access. Steel Wallets For Your Private Key Backup: Protect your private keys against physical damage by using steel wallets. These wallets safeguard your backup seed phrases or private keys from fire, water, and other environmental risks. They ensure that your crucial access information remains intact and retrievable by your heirs. Common Mistakes To Avoid With Crypto After Death When planning for the transfer of crypto assets after death, it‚Äôs crucial to be aware of common pitfalls. Avoiding these mistakes can save your beneficiaries from unnecessary stress and potential loss of assets: Lack Of Documentation: Failing to comprehensively document your crypto holdings and access information may result in the permanent loss of your assets. Ignoring Security Measures: Underestimating the importance of secure storage for access information can expose your assets to theft or loss. Overlooking Legal Aspects: Neglecting to incorporate your crypto assets into your will or estate plan properly can result in legal challenges for your heirs. Assuming Family Know-How: Assuming that your beneficiaries understand how to manage cryptocurrencies can lead to loss of assets. Provide clear instructions and, if possible, basic education on handling cryptocurrencies. Not Updating Your Plan: The crypto landscape and your personal portfolio are likely to evolve. Regularly update your estate plan to reflect changes in your holdings, the regulatory environment, and technological advancements.

They claim the reason for this is that ‚ÄúSOL has solidified its place in the market as one of the market leaders.‚Äù They also expect that SOL‚Äôs outperformance of ETH will continue in this market cycle.¬†\nMeanwhile, Zimmerman highlighted how SOL‚Äôs on-chain activity has continued to flourish and noted that the narrative of SOL being ETH‚Äôs main competitor was still intact. The Solana network has long been dubbed the ‚ÄúEthereum Killer,‚Äù with the belief that the former will dethrone the latter at some point.¬†\nIndeed, Solana has gone toe-to-toe with Ethereum in recent times, momentarily surpassing it in significant metrics. Back in December, Solana ranked above Ethereum in seven-day DEX volume for the first time in history and outperformed it in NFT trading volume during that same period. More recently, Solana‚Äôs Jupiter outranked Ethereum‚Äôs Uniswap in daily trading volume.¬†\nSOL also outperformed ETH last year, with the former seeing a gain of about 1000%. Crypto analyst Santiago Santos also recently gave his opinion on Solana and Ethereum‚Äôs fight for dominance. Comparing Ethereum‚Äôs run during the ICO boom to Solana‚Äôs current run, he noted that Solana had an edge since it has ‚Äúapplications seeing meaningful usage and growth.‚Äù¬†\nThis happens to be one of the reasons he believes that Solana will ‚Äúconverge on Ethereum faster than most believe.‚Äù\nWhat Price Levels Present Buying Opportunities For SOL\nHaving explained why SOL was the main focus among altcoins, the Navigating Narratives report highlighted price levels they were eyeing in case in case the market gives deeper pullbacks for SOL. These levels include the $70, $50 and $30 price range.¬†\nHowever, they noted that they weren‚Äôt expecting the $30 buy order to be filled since it would require a crash like the one that happened in March 2020. This was the period when Bitcoin lost almost half of its value in a two-day plunge. Other crypto tokens also experienced similar pain then.\nMeanwhile, if SOL continues to rally, K33 Research highlighted the $115 and $140 price ranges as ideal areas for selling and taking profits.¬†\nAt the time of writing, SOL is trading at around $99, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.¬†\nFeatured image from Adobe Stock, chart from TradingView",

This accomplishment occurred for the first time in December of 2023 when Solana‚Äôs daily DEX volume reached $1.475 billion, surpassing Ethereum‚Äôs $1.164 billion, and hit a growing interest by traders in the SOL ecosystem. Solana surpasses Ethereum in the DEX 24-hour volume. Source: DeFiLlama Solana also saw a weekly change of +37.67% in its trading volume. However, the data shows that Ethereum is still above Solana in the 7-day volume metric, with $7.852 billion and $ 6.113 billion, respectively. Additionally, data from CoinGecko shows that Solana-based DEXs Jupiter and Orca are among the 3 largest decentralized exchanges by volume in the last 24 hours. As the chart below displays, Jupiter has a daily volume of $ 614 million, while Orca shows a volume of $380 million, occupying the second and third spots, respectively.

Sorce: CoinGecko Research platform SoSo Value pointed out on X (formerly known as Twitter) the recent Jupiter‚Äôs rise in popularity and monthly users‚Äô increase as a key contributor to the Solana ecosystem‚Äôs boost in activity, bringing considerable attention and trading activity into the ecosystem. These recent achievements hint at a healthy growth and development of Solana‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem. Solana‚Äôs Price Action The surge in interest in Solana has been driven by its meme coin sector, the airdrops, and fast transactions offered to its users. As a result, its native token managed to reclaim previously lost territory. However, while Solana surpassed Ethereum‚Äôs DEX on low timeframes, the second crypto by market cap remains king of the DeFi sector. The chart above shows that the Ethereum-based DEX holds over $6 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). This piece of data indicates the resilience of the ETH ecosystem in maintaining its position as king of DeFi but holds promise for Solana. The fast-growing blockchain could attract further attention and interest if the daily trend extends. Despite some fluctuation in the last few weeks, Solana‚Äôs price has surfaced in the $90-$100 price range in the last month. According to CoinGecko data, SOL‚Äôs price has surged 1.9% in the last 24 hours and 6.3% in the previous 7 days.

However, the data shows that Ethereum is still above Solana in the 7-day volume metric, with $7.852 billion and $ 6.113 billion, respectively.\nAdditionally, data from CoinGecko shows that Solana-based DEXs Jupiter and Orca are among the 3 largest decentralized exchanges by volume in the last 24 hours. As the chart below displays, Jupiter has a daily volume of $ 614 million, while Orca shows a volume of $380 million, occupying the second and third spots, respectively.\nEthereum‚Äôs Uniswap V3 topped the chart with a daily volume of $636 million. The data also shows Raydium among the top 10 DEXs by volume in the last 24 hours.\n\nResearch platform SoSo Value pointed out on X (formerly known as Twitter) the recent Jupiter‚Äôs rise in popularity and monthly users‚Äô increase as a key contributor to the Solana ecosystem‚Äôs boost in activity, bringing considerable attention and trading activity into the ecosystem.\nThese recent achievements hint at a healthy growth and development of Solana‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem.\nSolana‚Äôs Price Action\nThe surge in interest in Solana has been driven by its meme coin sector, the airdrops, and fast transactions offered to its users. As a result, its native token managed to reclaim previously lost territory.\nHowever, while Solana surpassed Ethereum‚Äôs DEX on low timeframes, the second crypto by market cap remains king of the DeFi sector. The chart above shows that the Ethereum-based DEX holds over $6 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL).\nThis piece of data indicates the resilience of the ETH ecosystem in maintaining its position as king of DeFi but holds promise for Solana. The fast-growing blockchain could attract further attention and interest if the daily trend extends.\nDespite some fluctuation in the last few weeks, Solana‚Äôs price has surfaced in the $90-$100 price range in the last month. According to CoinGecko data, SOL‚Äôs price has surged 1.9% in the last 24 hours and 6.3% in the previous 7 days.\n",

However, the latest on-chain data shows that miners have been offloading their BTC, as they seem to be engaging in a selloff ahead of the halving event in April.\nMiners Sell $600 Million Worth Of BTC In Two Days: CryptoQuant\nIn a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, a pseudonymous analyst revealed that the Bitcoin miner reserves have been on a decline in the past few days. The relevant metric here is the ‚Äúminer reserve,‚Äù which tracks the total amount of BTC held in affiliated miners‚Äô wallets.\nTypically, this figure represents the Bitcoin reserve that miners are yet to sell to the open market. According to on-chain intelligence firm CryptoQuant, a dip in miner reserves often suggests potential selling pressure for the flagship cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant data, the miner reserves have slumped by over 14,000 BTC (worth about $600 million) over the past two days. The ‚Äúminer reserve‚Äù metric has been on a downward trend as far back as August 2022.\nThis latest decline has driven the indicator to its lowest level in nearly three years (since July 2021). While miners could be transferring substantial amounts of Bitcoin out of their wallets for various reasons, selling is one of the most probable reasons for the movement of funds.\nIn fact, the pseudonymous author of the Quicktake post mentioned that ‚Äúinteraction on exchange by miners‚Äù has increased in recent weeks. This interaction has intensified since the start of spot ETF trading in the US, the analyst noted.\nThis argument is further supported by the ‚ÄúMiner to Exchange Flow‚Äù indicator, which has been on the rise in the past few weeks. This metric measures the amount of Bitcoin that miners are moving to centralized exchanges. Generally, investors transfer their coins to these platforms for selling.\nThese miner selloffs often don‚Äôt have any impact on the price of Bitcoin, as the bearish pressure is readily absorbed by the market. Nevertheless, this on-chain perspective offers insight into market dynamics and the crypto ecosystem.\nBitcoin Price\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin price is down by a mere 0.1% while trading a little above $43,100. Meanwhile, the premier cryptocurrency has registered an over 3% profit on the weekly timeframe.\nBTC continues to maintain its position as the largest cryptocurrency in the sector, with a market capitalization of roughly $846 billion.\n",

Furthermore, within 15 days of the active ban, Zipmex is mandated to implement the SEC‚Äôs orders on its financial operation and alleged operational deficiencies.¬†\nIn addition, the crypto trading company is also required to design a working system that will protect investors‚Äô deposited assets against any form of exploitation. After this set period, Zipmex is expected to submit a report on these implementations to the SEC, approval of which will lead to the exchange‚Äôs resumption of operation.\nZipmex To Finally Shut Down?¬†\nFollowing the announcement of the SEC‚Äôs latest directive, Zipmex is yet to release an official statement or response. It is worth noting that the trading platform had been under regulatory scrutiny for over a year after filing for moratorium relief in 2022 in regard to a $97 million debt it owed customers.¬†\nIn November 2023, Zipmex proposed to pay its creditors 3.35 cents per dollar as in a debt repayment and restructuring plan. In the same month, the exchange also disabled trading and deposit services on its platform in November following an order by the SEC in regards to the company‚Äôs net liquid capital.\nNotably, in January, the exchange advised its customers to withdraw their assets from its platform, indicating that the crypto exchange might shut down its operations in the coming months, a sentiment further enforced by the SEC‚Äôs latest directive.¬†\nThe markets regulator has also directed that the exchange remains functional for withdrawals at all times, even amidst the operational ban. However, withdrawals off Zipmex can currently only be conducted manually, i.e., customers will have to contact customer care to initiate any withdrawal process.\n\nTotal crypto market cap valued at $1.61 trillion on the daily chart | Source: TOTAL chart on Tradingview.com",

        "content": "A group of creditors of the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX filed an adversary lawsuit in response to the proposed payout plans, seeking to establish that deposits are their property rather than FTX‚Äôs.¬†\nThe proposed plan of the defunct exchange would see creditors repaid based on November 2022 prices of digital assets, which are significantly lower than their current values. For instance, Bitcoin, currently valued at $43,250, was worth only $16,800 in November 2022.\nCreditors Demand ‚ÄòFair Valuation‚Äô Of Digital Assets\nIn their filing, the creditors highlight the need for a centralized approach to value the millions of unliquidated claims based on digital assets in the Chapter 11 Cases. They argue that a ‚Äúfair and compliant valuation‚Äù is necessary for plan solicitation, voting, setting reserves, and making distributions.¬†\nMost of the value of claims against FTX is based on US dollar-denominated fiat and stablecoins. At the same time, a significant portion includes other assets that are not easily converted to US dollars.\nTo address this, FTX proposes dollarizing the values of claims based on digital assets other than fiat and stablecoins. They rely on a Digital Assets Conversion Table, based on Coin Metrics pricing, to estimate the claims‚Äô values.¬†\nFTX believes that valuation based on the petition time pricing for digital assets is required under the Bankruptcy Code and offers the ‚Äúmost equitable approach.‚Äù\nHowever, the creditors‚Äô objections reflect varying opinions on how to value these claims, with each objector advocating for their interests. In contrast, FTX, as a fiduciary for the estates as a whole, seeks a methodology that complies with the Bankruptcy Code and treats creditors ‚Äúfairly.‚Äù¬†\nFTX Defends Digital Asset Valuation Methodology\nThe proposed order allows the court to evaluate claims based on digital assets before finalizing the disclosure statement and commencing the plan‚Äôs solicitation and voting.\nCertain objections concerning the valuation of specific digital assets, such as MAPS, OXY, and SRM, require further discovery and will be considered in a future evidentiary hearing in March 2024.¬†\nFTX acknowledges that estimation is appropriate for claims based on digital assets and asserts that the values provided in the Digital Assets Conversion Table are fair and suitable.\nMoreover, the exchange further argues that valuing assets as of the petition date is necessary to acknowledge a volatile market and prevent claim values from fluctuating post-petition.\nThe bankrupt exchange‚Äôs legal team contends that treating some digital assets differently based on post-petition appreciation or depreciation would result in disparate treatment, violating the Bankruptcy Code and being inequitable for creditors.\nDespite complaints from creditors regarding the significant price changes since the petition date, Bitcoinist reported that FTX maintains that bankruptcy law requires digital asset repayment prices to be determined based on the filing date for bankruptcy in November 2022.\nAs the legal battle unfolds, the court‚Äôs decision on the valuation of digital assets and the lawsuit‚Äôs resolution will have significant implications for FTX‚Äôs creditors and the broader crypto community.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com ",

This initiative, announced by the region‚Äôs Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), underscores Hong Kong‚Äôs commitment to ensuring a ‚Äútransparent‚Äù digital asset marketplace.\nThe local government‚Äôs impending publication of this regulatory consultation represents a critical step in addressing the risks associated with OTC crypto venues, which have become increasingly accessible to the general public, according to the announcement.\nProposal To Regulate OTC Venture\nChristopher Hui, Hong Kong‚Äôs Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury emphasized the necessity of this regulation in the announcement. His concern stems from OTC venues‚Äò role¬†in several fraud cases involving unlicensed virtual asset (VA) trading platforms. Hui noted:\nIn fact, OTC venues have played a certain role in some of the fraud cases involving some unlicensed VA trading platforms last year, having misled investors to channel funds to these unlicensed platforms.\nThis issue highlights the growing need for regulatory oversight in an area that, until now, has operated with minimal supervision. The proposed framework aims to safeguard crypto investors by ensuring these platforms operate in a ‚Äúregulated and monitored‚Äù environment. Hui explained:\nTherefore, we believe that it is necessary to bring OTC venues under regulation, and we will launch a consultation very soon on the proposed regulatory framework.\nThe imminent consultation by Hong Kong‚Äôs financial authorities aims to bring these OTC venues under a ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù regulatory regime. This move is expected to align the operations of these platforms with global best practices, ensuring that they provide ‚Äúsafe and fair‚Äù trading environments for their users.\nHong Kong‚Äôs Progressive Steps In Crypto Regulation\nThis regulatory development in Hong Kong comes six months after the region‚Äôs Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) took proactive steps to integrate retail investors safely into the crypto market. This step included upgrading HashKey, a local exchange, to offer regulated crypto services to retail investors under newly established guidelines.\nMoreover, Hong Kong contemplated allowing individual investors to participate in spot Crypto ETFs late last year. This move, part of strategic initiatives to establish the city as a leading digital asset hub in the Asia-Pacific region, was later realized when the authorities announced their readiness to accept applications for spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nThe SFC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority jointly published circulars laying the groundwork for this significant development. Interestingly, this decision followed shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved several spot BTC ETF applications.\nHarvest Fund Hong Kong, a major fund company in China, has already applied to a Bitcoin spot ETF to the Hong Kong SFC, marking a pivotal moment in the region‚Äôs financial landscape. The SFC is reportedly considering expediting the approval process for this spot ETF, with plans for a potential listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange soon after the Chinese New Year.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView",

Later details provided by Ripple executives clarified that the company did not manage the compromised accounts.\nIn a recent development, leading crypto exchange Binance has identified and frozen part of the stolen funds.\nPartial Recovery Of The Stolen XRP\nAs previously reported, news about a possible hack on addresses associated with Ripple made headlines and plummeted XRP‚Äôs price to $0.5070. Later that day, Chris Larsen, Ripple‚Äôs Co-founder, confirmed on the X platform (Formerly known as Twitter) that unauthorized access to some of his accounts had occurred the day prior, clarifying that Ripple wallets were secured and that law enforcement had already been notified.\nAccording to crypto detective ZachXBT, the attack took approximately $112.5 million worth of XRP tokens from the compromised wallets. The stolen tokens were sent through several exchanges, including Binance.\nOn February 1, Binance CEO Richard Teng announced on the X platform that part of the stolen funds had been successfully identified and frozen by the exchange‚Äôs Team. Although the recovery is important, it accounts for a small fraction of the stolen tokens, as only $4.2 million worth of XRP has been recovered so far.\n\nAfter finding out early on about the exploit that occurred at @Ripple, we‚Äôre happy to say that the #Binance team has managed to freeze $4.2 Million worth of $XRP stolen by the exploiter.\nWe appreciate both the communities efforts in flagging it to exchanges ‚Äì as always @zachxbt‚Ä¶\n‚Äî Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) February 1, 2024\n\nTeng informed the community that the Ripple and Binance teams are collaborating. The crypto exchange will continue supporting the payment company in the investigation to retrieve the stolen funds.\nAdditionally, they will closely monitor the funds in the exploiter‚Äôs external wallets if deposited to Binance. The exchange‚Äôs CEO took the opportunity to thank both communities for their efforts in identifying and waning the parties involved, encouraging users and projects to reach out to the Binance team in instances like this.\nAre ‚ÄúIrresponsible‚Äù Exchanges Preferred By Exploiters?\nThomas Silkj√¶r, Head of Analytics and Compliance at the XRP Ledger Foundation, thanked Binance‚Äôs CEO for the quick and responsible acting of the team but considered the post‚Äôs wording ‚Äúa bit ambiguous.‚Äù\n\nThank you for acting quickly and responsibly.\nThis tweet is a bit ambiguous. \n1) The compromised accounts are personal accounts of @chrislarsensf ‚Äì not an exploit at @Ripple2) The initial investigation was done by @XRPLF and initiated as it was happening ‚Äì not carelessly‚Ä¶\n‚Äî Thomas Silkj√¶r (@Silkjaer) February 1, 2024\n\nSilkj√¶r remarked that the compromised accounts were personal wallets of Ripple‚Äôs co-founder instead of an exploit at Ripple. He also explained that the XRP Ledger Foundation did a complete handover of the data to Ripple as the firm is now leading the investigation for Larsen.\nAnswering a question from Neil Hartner, a Senior Staff Software engineer at Ripple, Silkj√¶r provided some insight into the first steps of an exploit investigation, explaining that exchanges don‚Äôt have a systematic way to share and broadcast fraud incidents. He explained:\n\nNot completely systemic, but through networks it‚Äôs possible to act quickly to many threats. Such as the Crypto Defenders Alliance (CDA). Over time you develop great relationships, and it is evident through these relationships who the responsible and irresponsible exchanges are.\n\nRegarding the possibility of publicly identifying ‚Äúirresponsible exchanges‚Äù and whether it would benefit exploiters, Silkj√¶r stated that ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt necessarily care‚Äù as their Modus Operandi (MO) doesn‚Äôt take into consideration whether the exchanges are responsible or irresponsible.\n\nTypical MO of these people are (in simple terms):\n‚Äì Deposit to multiple exchanges, exchange, withdraw.\n‚Äì Continue until they freeze your account. So small amounts first, then larger and larger amounts as confidence is built.\nSo they don‚Äôt necessarily care.\n\nAt the time of writing, only Binance has announced the identification and subsequent freezing of part of the stolen funds. ZachXBT previously identified six other exchanges the exploiters used to send the funds, including MEXC, Gate, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, HitBTC, etc.\n\nCover image from Unsplash, chart from Tradingview",

This trend may suggest a shift in investor preference, with some viewing Bitcoin as a digital alternative to traditional safe-haven assets.\nEven so, when adjusted for inflation, gold flows remain slightly larger. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin ETFs were launched when gold had established its presence in the market, becoming a store of value asset for the better part of human history.\nAnalysts responding to Hougan‚Äôs comparison also note that the figure could have been higher. Over the past few weeks, since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Grayscale Investment has been liquidating its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), offloading billions worth of BTC. \nGrayscale Investment is actively unwinding its GBTC trust, converting it to an ETF. Therefore, the CIO notes that excluding GBTC, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of $7.1 billion over the last two periods, significantly exceeding gold.¬†\nAccording to Lookonchain¬†data, GBTC sold 5,086 BTC worth over $218 million as of February 1. At the same time, eight spot Bitcoin issuers scooped 8,907 BTC worth over $382 million. \nOut of this amount, Fidelity bought 5,422 BTC. Fidelity controls over 59,000 BTC, coming second after BlackRock, whose fund has bought over 66,200 BTC as of February 1.\n\nWriting On The Wall For Gold?\nThis rapid shift is monumental. It notably highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to disrupt the traditional investment landscape and spots Bitcoin ETFs. Over the years since launching, Bitcoin has grown to command a market cap of over $840 billion, data from CoinMarketCap shows.¬†\nSupporters are accumulating Bitcoin, citing its deflationary nature and long-term growth potential. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that some public companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square hold millions and billions of dollars in the coin.\n\nBitcoin is firm but wobbling when writing, moving sideways, as evidenced by the daily chart. Bulls have failed to break above $47,000 and $50,000, with the odds of further losses below $39,500 rising.",

        "content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nOn Sunday, February 4, El Salvador‚Äôs presidential election will determine whether Nayib Bukele and his revolutionary experiment with Bitcoin will have a continued presence in the nation‚Äôs future.Since Nayib Bukele became President of El Salvador in 2019, he has enjoyed a fairly broad base of support; he was the first man since 1984 to win independently of the nation‚Äôs two major political parties. The topic that has taken his administration to a subject of worldwide discussion, however, has been his support of Bitcoin. Bukele made world history in September 2021 when he raised it to the status of legal currency, and El Salvador‚Äôs radical experiment with Bitcoin has captivated interest worldwide ever since.Bitcoin Magazine Pro is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support our work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Naturally, a large deal of this interest has been negative, especially from the financial and media establishment worldwide. The Bitcoin law went into effect mere weeks before bitcoin fell from its all-time highs, and this led to no small amount of speculation that the government would lose huge sums as a result. More pressingly, financial institutions like the IMF also repeatedly urged El Salvador to give up on its project, raising the possibility that the country might lose access to loans. However, as of 2024, not only have the government‚Äôs investments into bitcoin stockpiles gone firmly into the black, but major financial institutions have also grudgingly accepted the strength of the Salvadoran economy. The nation‚Äôs critics have been disproven from this angle, but there‚Äôs one more immediate test on the horizon: the matter of Bukele‚Äôs re-election.In an interview on January 31, Bukele‚Äôs running mate Felix Ulloa went to great lengths to stress that a re-election will mean a firm re-commitment to Bitcoin. Although Ulloa revealed that the IMF has quietly been repeating its requests to de-list bitcoin in El Salvador, he was insistent that these pleas are falling on deaf ears. A particular source of strength, he claimed to Reuters, was the takeoff of the ETF in the United States. A major victory like this means for him that Bitcoin ‚Äúenjoys the greatest credibility in the entire world.‚Äù Not only did Ulloa claim that the existing laws in support of Bitcoin ‚Äúwill be maintained‚Äù, but he also added that the proposed ‚ÄúBitcoin City'' infrastructure project continues to enjoy the government‚Äôs full support.As far as the polls are concerned, a wide variety of international press agencies all agree that Bukele‚Äôs victory is practically guaranteed. The centerpiece of his popularity, it seems, actually has nothing to do with Bitcoin, as large numbers of citizens remain unconvinced. Instead, it seems his sweeping crackdowns on gang activity are the main reason, causing El Salvador‚Äôs murder rate to plummet from a shocking 105 murders per 100k residents in 2015 to 7.8 per 100k, the lowest in the region. In other words, his voters love him extensively, but as of yet they remain ambivalent on the Bitcoin initiative. Fickle support like this could indeed be dangerous, as future economic difficulties could turn this indifference into outright rejection. However, as far as all polling suggests, Bukele will have another term to convince his people.\n\nSource\nLuckily, there are extensive plans in place to attempt to deepen these connections in multiple spheres of life. The usage of an international currency like bitcoin has attracted the flow of international spending, with tourism to the nation spiking in recent years. In addition to these more casual inflows of cash, the government has also encouraged more permanent immigration by allowing foreign nationals to directly purchase citizenship with bitcoin investment. These attempts to raise foreign dollars can definitely impact the nation‚Äôs citizens, but there are also efforts underway to directly create jobs in this burgeoning industry.Since October, El Salvador has partnered with several firms to create mining infrastructure powered by geothermal energy. Bitcoin mining is a growing market worldwide, and the use of green energy easily sidesteps the most common refrain against it. These goals of creating domestic jobs and attracting foreign investment both fall under the umbrella of the aforementioned ‚ÄúBitcoin City‚Äù project, a plan with the long-term goal of fostering all the multifarious jobs in software development and blockchain engineering associated with the digital asset space. If El Salvador‚Äôs voters do decide to re-elect Bukele on February 4, he‚Äôll have his work cut out for him to ensure that Bitcoin is an enduring presence. As of yet, many of his citizens are either earning extra revenue from international travelers interested in Bitcoin, or involved in building the new pools to mine it. Although the economy is growing, this has not been sufficient to win his people over to the full possibilities of a radical new economic future. Nevertheless, he has won their love anyway, as his government has continually enjoyed fierce public support. In other words, re-election is very likely, and the experiment will continue for the five years of his second term. The major challenge of these five years, however, will be to ensure that Bitcoin will become a fact of life for his people. Still, as daunting of a task as this may seem, he has already been working on normalizing Bitcoin in a wide variety of ways. Just as one example of this, last year the country partnered with one of its largest distributors, enabling huge numbers of businesses to begin accepting bitcoin for the most mundane transactions. Furthermore, these normalization efforts have extended beyond El Salvador‚Äôs borders. El Salvador needs the support of its citizens, but it also wishes to encourage broader support from other nations. The Central African Republic (CAR) was directly inspired by El Salvador when it briefly became the second nation to adopt bitcoin as a legal currency. However, this effort was simply impossible to sustain in a country where around 90% of citizens do not have internet access, and it was shuttered in 2023. CAR was not the only country to be influenced by Bukele‚Äôs government, as he actually sent a team of ‚ÄúBitcoin Ambassadors‚Äù to Argentina upon the election of its newest President last November. Outreach efforts like this will go a long way to ensure that El Salvador is the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender, but won‚Äôt be the last. Get more from Bitcoin Magazine Pro in the Substack appAvailable for iOS and AndroidSome of these initiatives highlight the way that El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin project has radically different aims from the ETF battle in the United States, even though Salvadorans like Vice President Ulloa are naturally heartened by its victory. The ETF is a financial instrument that allows ordinary Americans some extra opportunities to indirectly profit from Bitcoin‚Äôs success, while Bitcoin has a radical vision for anyone in the world to take control of their economic fortunes. Nayib Bukele has shown a real interest in fostering Bitcoin as a part of everyday life, as shown by the variety of ways he‚Äôs encouraged economic development and his attempts at international outreach. Our community needs fighters like those who pursued the ETF battle, but it‚Äôs important to remember that Bitcoin means so much more than a way to earn fiat currency. If Bukele has the chance to really embed Bitcoin in El Salvador‚Äôs society, it‚Äôll show the world what kind of success Bitcoin can offer us all.",

        "title": "Instant Settlement Series: Real Time Streaming Payments",
        "summary": "The fourth part in an article series by Ivan Makedonski from Breez on how Lightning's instant settlement finality can be a disruptive force fundamentally changing how different industries are organized.",
        "content": "With the previous articles, we found the disconnect between paid-for work and paid-for time. We also understood that if you want to get paid you have to provide work that is valuable for others. So when the person consumes the benefit of your work, the exchange happens value for value - work for sats. But what happens if the benefit that the consumer experiences is not a momentary but a continuous process? There are a few examples of this. I will start with the one that is not that captivating but still valuable.Streaming services, like other industries, grapple with the limitations of the fiat payment system. The burden of fees and the absence of suitable technology for streaming payments have compelled them to adopt similar mitigations as other industries. This translates to charging users on a monthly basis.With the Lightning Network, we have the technology to stream sats for content. No longer confined to monthly subscriptions, you pay for what you consume in real time. Whether you watch sporadically or binge extensively, streaming payments allow for a more personalized and efficient payment model. This way the creator of the content and the user have a direct connection for each minute the content is broadcasted. With streaming payments now you can say goodbye to subscription payments.Unveiling A New Era Of Fair Compensation And Accountability In Movie ProductionImagine you've created a movie or documentary. Traditionally, you'd charge people for a ticket, essentially asking them to pay upfront for future value, creating a slight disconnect. Now, with streaming payments using sats, consumers can pay as they watch. If your movie sucks, they might only pay for the first 30 minutes. However, you still receive value, and viewers won't feel overcharged for something they didn't enjoy. If your movie is great they not only stream sats the whole time but at the end, they leave a tip.On the receiving side of the movie most people involved in it received a salary for doing their job. As we already know this is not aligning the whole structure in the same direction. Some people do not care at all how good the movie is if they have already been paid and do not receive a bonus further. Some people might care about reputation in the market but very few just want to do the best job. Again, we went through this, and as you are guessing you just do a split payment in the backend where all the people in the credits actually receive sats or even milisatoshis based on their contribution. This was something I did not expect that Bitcoin would disrupt. This way the reputation is directly linked to the payment and a lot more people will fight to have the best movie. You can be someone who contributed to a project and wants to stay anonymous for whatever reason but still receive money - Lightning instant settlement is the way to do it.These concepts should not be new if you read through the last 3 articles. In addition, people in the Bitcoin space are familiar with the Value for Value (V4V) podcasting and that is very close to what I am describing above. While the technology for podcasting is already in place, it's surprising how few podcasts leverage this technology to implement split payments effectively. They give that responsibility to some hosting service that decides to take a 5% split for themselves and the other 95% goes to the wallet of the show. Why not do the split the proper way? The hosting service provides value so they should get a percentage but if you are 3 people involved in the production of the podcast you should have that 95% split so it goes to those individuals. There's no excuse, especially for Bitcoin podcasts, not to make this effort and implement split payments appropriately.The Dynamic Future Of Pay-as-you-go In Content ConsumptionIn this example, the pay-as-you-go model holds true for continuous experiences, like streaming. Now, let's revisit the movie example. If you're a theater, you are essentially the hosting provider for the movie. The quality of the theater experience can vary; one theater might have uncomfortable chairs, while another boasts luxurious massage chairs. The theater with subpar seating might receive a 3% share of the movie's streaming sats revenue, while the one with comfortable massage chairs might earn 5% for each sat stream paying for the movie. Furthermore, if a viewer activates the massage function of the chair, additional sats are streamed for each second that the function is on. I do not know the exact payment dynamics between theaters and movie studios but I bet there are prepayments and funds held at multiple points in the fiat payment process. With the adoption of the Lightning Network, theaters no longer have to prepay for movies to be projected on their screens. They can now observe which movies are most popular in real time and adjust their projections accordingly to optimize revenues. This benefits the consumer and optimizes profits for themselves and the creators of the movie.Now you see the content gets its value stream for the continuous experience and everyone in the film industry will fight to give the best experience for the most amount of time. The better the experience the more sats flow their way. Due to the highly subjective nature of content, where one person might deem a movie subpar, another might label it as their favorite. This subjectivity is why I believe most content streaming will not have a predetermined price. Even movies may adopt the V4V model, similar to what Adam Curry is pioneering in podcasting. For instance, you watch a movie, and during the credits, a prominent QR code appears, allowing you to decide how much you want to send to the creators of the movie. You will listen to a song or a podcast the same way. Whether you predefine a streaming rate per minute or request payment at the end, both options are technically possible. However, the market will ultimately determine which option prevails as the better one. Also, why not have a bidding competition for any event that has assigned seats? The person who bids the most for a ticket gets to be in the first row of the concert or a sports stadium. This way the subjectivity is left for all the viewers to decide how valuable it really is. This way it ensures a full stadium also because if there is no value in attending the event people are not going to bid for the seats or just pay 1 sat for it.Revolutionizing Taxi Transactions For Drivers And Passengers AlikeThe continuous experience or service for streaming could be anything in the physical realm. I will take a look at how instant settlement could look like in transportation services. One such transportation service is the taxi service. Even though Uber decentralized the taxi companies which is great they did nothing about decentralizing the payment process. Lightning Network fixes that and more.With a streaming payment option for each meter of movement, taxi drivers no longer need to wait until the end destination to receive their payment. In a world of instant settlement, payment occurs as you go, eliminating the risk for the taxi driver regarding whether the passenger will pay at the end of the journey. While this might not be a groundbreaking improvement, there are several additional benefits to consider.Why do most taxis operate with cash? Taxi drivers in most places need a POS device for the customers to be able to pay for a better user experience (UX). It may be a better UX but on the other hand, it creates problems for the drivers either way:They have to acquire clunky devices.They must pay payment processing fees, negatively impacting their margins.Operating solely with cash exposes them to the honeypot problem, carrying a substantial amount of money, and making them vulnerable to theft.With an app tailored for the taxi experience and integrated with the Lightning Network, these issues become irrelevant. There is no need for additional equipment, no payment processing fees for receiving money, and no exposure to visible cash, reducing the risk of being a target for theft. Now you can have a better UX with better security and better margins - an additional benefit is that it will be paid with Bitcoin. Not only that but just like the example with the movie theater chairs drivers will be incentivized to make the travel experience even better. They can offer - to watch a movie, video games like PlayStation, or massage chair. If you choose to use those extra experiences on top of the travel experience you have to increase the sats streaming their way.An additional benefit for the travel experience of customers arises when multiple passengers in a taxi have different destinations. Traditionally, the taxi meter ticks for the entire journey, and when the first person is dropped off, determining a fair amount for their portion becomes complex. However, with the Lightning Network, it's conceivable to streamline this process. Imagine a scenario where three passengers enter a taxi, each with distinct destinations. Each person scans a QR code upon entering, linking their streaming sats to the taxi app. The app manages split-receiving, dynamically adjusting the distribution of streaming payments based on how many people are in the taxi. As passengers are dropped off one by one, the app seamlessly adjusts the split-receiving, providing a fair and efficient payment solution for each individual's share of the journey. Optimizing City Transportation With Streaming SatsThe proposed model of split-receiving through QR codes and streaming sats can extend beyond taxi services to other modes of transportation, such as buses. The idea is to calculate the average cost per mile (or meter/foot) for providing the transportation service, including factors like fuel, maintenance, and driver salary, and add a margin for profit. Passengers entering the vehicle scan a QR code, and the app dynamically adjusts the streaming payments based on the number of people on board.For buses, this model allows for real-time adjustment of streaming payments as passengers enter and exit. If there are 30 people on the bus the split is between them. At the next stop, 10 people are dropped off and 5 people get on board - now the sats stream is divided by 25 people. As the number of people on the bus changes at each stop, the streaming sats are proportionally divided among the passengers. This approach can lead to more efficient and flexible city transportation. Late-night buses will be more expensive for the passengers because of the fewer riders, while buses during peak hours may offer a more cost-effective traveling experience as payments are shared among more passengers.This system encourages transportation optimization around events, such as concerts or sports games, where private buses or minivans wait to fill up before departing. Routes can be dynamically adjusted because you will have a system tracking how many people are in the vehicles at what time and at what location on the map. Importantly, this data remains anonymous, as no KYC information is required for the Lightning Network payments.The Streamlined Pay-from-a-distanceNow with this streaming money feature, it can be applied differently. Let‚Äôs go back to the taxi service for a moment. The pay-from-a-distance feature that is available in the Lightning Network can significantly enhance the experience of ordering a taxi. Instead of the traditional model where drivers wait patiently and charge fixed fees when passengers enter the car, this model introduces streaming sats from the moment the passenger accepts the ride. Here's how it works:The passenger places an order in the app, specifying the destination. Nothing new here.Drivers see the order and can apply for it, similar to platforms like Uber.Streaming sats start the moment the passenger accepts the driver, and streaming payments commence. This fee will be less than the actual transportation but the user is still paying for the service of the car coming to him and not the other way around.The taxi arrives at the passenger's door, and the streaming payments continue. There is a fee for waiting at the door per minute.By shifting the waiting cost to the passenger, there's a strong incentive for both parties to be prompt, and the system becomes more efficient. Additionally, the passenger's responsibility to follow the car reduces operational costs related to alerting passengers via message or a call. Any inefficient time management becomes a cost for the passenger. This model aligns incentives for both drivers and passengers, creating a more seamless cost and time-effective taxi experience.The concept of paying from a distance can be creatively applied to various scenarios, providing convenience and peace of mind. For instance, when it comes to sending your child somewhere with a taxi, traditional concerns about trusting them with money or the driver's reliability may arise. However, with the ability to stream sats for the ride, you gain real-time visibility on your device, tracking your child's journey and ensuring they reach the intended destination safely. This pay-from-a-distance feature extends beyond transportation and can be applied to other continuous services. For example, daycare services charge per minute, allowing you to stream payments in real-time, ensuring accurate and fair compensation for the duration your child spends there. Additionally, you can send a present to a friend, such as a massage session, and pay for it in a streaming fashion, covering the cost continuously based on the duration of the service. The flexibility of streaming payments not only offers real-time tracking and control but also opens up new possibilities for various services where charging per minute or duration is relevant. Those services can be paid on the spot or from a distance.\n\nI know that now it looks like we are going backwards from the original point of never paying money for time. The key distinction here is that you may be paying for time past for the service but in that time you get a continuous stream of value (work done) so you are streaming value back to pay for it. In some cases the time spent is actually an accurate measure of the work done.It's true that developing apps with such functionalities is technically feasible, and there might be entrepreneurs and developers willing to explore these possibilities. However, a significant challenge arises when considering custodial control over users' funds. Small startups might find it financially burdensome and complex to operate as custodians, potentially steering away from such responsibilities. This will take not only high responsibility but also a very big financial wall and expertise to obtain the licenses that comply with the ever-changing regulations. On the other hand, large tech companies with substantial resources could afford to take on the role of custodians, presenting both a business opportunity for them and a risk for the users. The move by some tech giants, like X(formerly Twitter), to obtain such licenses can be seen as a strategic measure for self-preservation over their own finances. This is also an opportunity to consolidate control over not only user data but user finances within their platforms.The Breez SDK offers a powerful solution, empowering developers to create diverse applications without having to worry about payment intricacies. Its non-custodial nature is a key advantage, eliminating the need for licenses. The infrastructure of it is made in such a way that it is peer-to-peer so no one is holding money for someone else. The app developers focus on the experience within the app and just plug in the code. This combination of features gives startups a competitive edge and reverses the advantage held by large tech companies. While they go through the complex process of getting a license the startup can integrate the global payment network (the Lightning Network) in one day. Even if certain tech giants choose to lock users' funds within their applications, alternative options will continue to be developed, and users will have the freedom to opt-out. Just like people are choosing Bitcoin over fiat.Now who is ready to give all of us those experiences in their app?This is a guest post by Ivan Makedonski.

        "content": "Bitcoin is fixing money. Thanks to Bitcoin, anyone in the world is free to transfer money over a peer-to-peer network without having to go through a financial institution. Money that cannot be censored by authorities, devalued by governments, monopolized by corporations, or stopped by borders.However, when it comes to trading, going through a trusted third party still remains necessary. Why is that a problem? Because trusted third parties always have been, and continue to be, security holes. Bitcoin Trading Is BrokenIndividuals and financial institutions alike rely on trusted third parties such as clearinghouses and exchanges to clear their Bitcoin spot and derivatives transactions.‚ÄúBanks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.‚Äù - Satoshi Nakamoto, 2 Nov 2009Sound familiar? Yes, that‚Äôs exactly what happened during the 2022 contagion event where Celsius, Terra, Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, Voyager, FTX and many more collapsed. Most of the time, end users, who trusted these third parties, lost everything.Centralized exchanges are inherently insecure because funds can be pooled together without any oversight. Trading and custody should never, ever be mixed.Looking at the above list of bankruptcies, one may feel helpless and declare Bitcoin trading a no go. Instead, we took a second look and wondered: does Bitcoin trading really need to take place in the books of a trusted third party? Certainly not. And Bitcoin itself provides the solution!Bitcoin is a complex and dynamic system that has not yet found its equilibrium, and no one can predict the ultimate role it will play. Defining Bitcoin is challenging because it intersects multiple domains. Some view it as a financial asset, others as a currency, a network, or even as an ideological manifesto.As developers of innovative trading solutions, we are particularly interested in one dimension: Bitcoin as a technical infrastructure. This technical dimension is the least visible, probably due to its relative complexity, yet we find it one of the most fascinating aspects of this Unidentified Financial Object (UFO).And we firmly believe that Bitcoin the protocol provides the ideal building blocks for the development of sound financial services.Building The Future Of Trading On BitcoinBitcoin's code consists of operations that, when assembled, form a script. This list of available elementary operations evolved over time, with the addition of new operations to enable more complex scripts. These evolutions are often slow, but this gradual pace helps preserve the stability and security of the protocol.The simplest script, of course, is the peer-to-peer transfer of a unit of value. The first trading platforms were built by integrating this functionality: it became possible to transfer funds directly from a wallet to a platform for processing.The Lightning Network is an application built from a more complex script. It allows for the risk-free and instantaneous transfer of BTC. LN Markets was the first trading platform to integrate this new protocol into its core development.Targeting the retail market, its value proposition is an extreme simplification of the trading experience: it takes only a few seconds for a user to handle everything from account creation to collateral transfer, all done instantly from a Lightning wallet. The value proposition of instant trading brought more than $2 billion cumulative trading volume.\n\nBuilding on this success, it was only natural for us to turn our attention to Discreet Log Contracts. A DLC is a native ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù built on Bitcoin which enables the delivery of a payoff depending only on the publication of a price by an oracle.Today, we think it‚Äôs time to build on the DLC protocol to enable full trustless trading and put an end to the pooling of funds by trusted third parties.Trust Minimized Trading On Bitcoin Is Now A RealityOver the past few months, we have been building in stealth mode a trustless OTC derivatives trading platform designed to meet the needs of crypto financial institutions: DLC Markets.Any kind of financial instrument can be traded on DLC Markets with almost no counterparty risk: Bitcoin futures and options, products on hashrate and blockspace, and potentially any asset in the world.Traditionally, trading for institutions has always been centralized and standardized. At some point, a clearinghouse (CCP) takes control of the funds and manages settlement. Paradoxically, despite technological advancements, Bitcoin trading is much riskier than traditional trading: no regulation, trading and custody in the same place, conflicts of interest, numerous risks, and frequent bankruptcies. DLC Markets aims to address these issues. Drawing inspiration from traditional OTC trading, we are developing a marketplace where participants can meet and transact. Similar to an ISDA/CSA agreement, collateral is exchanged directly between peers.To manage settlement, a smart contract (DLC) acts as a CCP. This smart contract is unique to each transaction, ensuring segregated fund management, complete transparency for transaction participants, and confidentiality from external actors.Market participants can chat and submit bilateral requests for quotes (RFQ) to each other. Upon mutual agreement for a trade, they confirm the trades parameters and submit the initial margin to a smart contract on the Bitcoin blockchain. Throughout the life of the trade, margin calls, liquidation, and settlement may take place and unlock the corresponding outcome in the smart contract. The computation of any settlement is contingent solely on the publication of an independent oracle.The oracle is a trusted third party to verify certain events accurately. Unlike an escrow, the oracle is not tasked with interpreting or executing the contract. No explicit approval is required from the oracle to establish or unilaterally settle the contract. The only requirement is the use of data published regularly by the oracle, which is both freely available and shareable.While traditional DLCs can be cumbersome to implement, we introduce a novel approach with a coordinator to solve the free-option dilemma when the DLC is initiated. This approach also makes it possible to integrate margin calls, liquidation and netting in the DLC process.\n\nTime flow chart of margin call steps and hedged period for DLC with most expected transactions format For a technical deep dive on our solution, check our white paper.The Future Is NowDLC Markets represents a paradigm shift, offering a trustless and secure alternative to the centralized exchanges that have long dominated the financial sector.

        "summary": "Lina Seiche gives a first hand account of her experiences moving to and living in El Salvador in the wake of the country passing the Bitcoin Law.",
        "content": "Last year, I planned a hike through El Boquer√≥n, a national park atop the San Salvador Volcano that features a scenic crater, as well as a tiny crater within that crater called Boqueroncito (‚ÄùLittle Boquer√≥n‚Äù), which I find adorable. In true millennial fashion, I consulted a handful of travel blogs to make sure I was well-prepared for the trip. A blog entry by a couple of tourists caught my attention. Be careful to avoid the advanced hike route, it read, as you might run into aggressive stray dogs. Now, getting bitten by a dog and then spending hours seeing my life flash before my eyes as I rushed to the nearest hospital wasn‚Äôt really appealing to me. Suddenly unsure of my plans, I called my Salvadoran friend Sara to tell her about my concerns. She straight-up laughed. ‚ÄúI am so happy,‚Äù she exclaimed, ‚Äúthat your biggest concern here are stray dogs, and no longer the gangs.‚Äù In the end, my stray dog worry was unfounded‚Äîyou know that‚Äôs not the point of this anecdote, but lest there be any confusion, I had the best time, and nobody bit me. The world feels like a weird place lately, and I‚Äôve wondered more than once whether past generations have felt the same. When the gaps between crises close and each of them leaves a scar deeper than the last, and when we see before our very eyes how things change, gradually, then suddenly, it leaves me no other conclusion except that we are living through the end of an era, if not the end of an empire; I know that sounds dramatic, but one way or another, it is definitely a time our children will look back upon, shaking their heads going, ‚Äúhow could they not see it coming!‚ÄùAs bitcoiners, we pride ourselves in ‚Äúseeing it coming.‚Äù (For the record, I don‚Äôt think we do, but that‚Äôs a different conversation.) We are witnessing the bloody decay of entire countries‚Äô financial backbones. State-level corruption is socially acceptable. ‚ÄúSo, our government is hella shady, whaddaya do?‚Äù Move, that‚Äôs what ya do. At least that‚Äôs what I did. Then again, most of the time that means jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. I‚Äôve spent the last ten years traveling the world, and in just about any country I have visited or lived in, I could see shades of the same pattern forming. The general mood is shifting; people are struggling to plan, let alone build their futures and, as a result of this and other influences, delving into destructive high-time preference distractions. Bitcoiners seek to escape this vicious cycle. For you and me, Bitcoin is a lifeboat. A lifeboat is great. It protects you from the tide and keeps your head afloat. But who wants to live on a lifeboat? A boat needs a harbor to dock. Enter the smallest country in America. El Salvador was never on my radar. By that I mean, it was so very far outside my radar that the first time I even heard about it was when Nayib Bukele announced he was making Bitcoin legal tender. I had the privilege of meeting the president a few months after the Bitcoin Law became official, at the very affordable cost of one of my first plushie prototypes. At the time, he was on a state visit to Turkey; when my business partner Danny and I went to meet him, he showed up flanked by his security detail and what I assumed were at least 50 members of staff. What immediately caught my eye was the youthful energy in that colorful mix. Unbeknownst to me, it was a teaser of the spirit that had gripped the country. This kind of optimism was all but alien to me. Where I‚Äôm from, governments are sluggish, bloated, boomer-operated calcified machines (I could‚Äôve added more adjectives, but you get my gist). The experience made me decide to go and check out the country myself. It took me a year and a half to make the trip, but I made up for it‚Äîby staying. El Salvador is one hell of a place. At first, I thought it was just me, that perhaps my personal bias skewed my experience from the moment I set foot here. But so far, every single person I‚Äôve spoken with confirmed my own impression: something is different about this country, and it took coming here to really grasp it. Let me attempt an explanation anyway and tell you why I moved myself and my company to Bitcoin Country‚Äîspoiler alert: it wasn‚Äôt for the Bitcoin Law. Enter El Salvador‚ÄúPeople really drive like madmen here,‚Äù Sara moaned as we set out for our roadtrip during my first week in El Salvador. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen worse,‚Äù I said. Not about to drop names, but compared to some other places I‚Äôve seen, the traffic in El Salvador isn‚Äôt half-bad. We drove along the famous Ruta de las Flores, a scenic road winding its way through tropical hillscapes, connecting numerous lively townships and sleepy villages. Our destination was the famed village of Ataco, not too far from the border to Guatemala, where Sara had looked up a little restaurant serving traditional Sopa de Gallina, or hen soup. On a small veranda off to the back of the place sat a weathered rocking chair that smelt of leaves and rain. As I walked up to the edge of the porch and peaked beyond at the sprawling forest below, a dizzy sensation gripped me and pulled my feet back a couple of steps. We ate hen soup, thick corn tortillas, cheese, and chorizo, all with a view that would‚Äôve made you believe somebody had thrown a real-life Instagram filter onto the landscape. When I was little, I would see sceneries like these printed on the centerfold of travel magazines, or postered on the inside of the local supermarket window. Gazing upon the lush tree-covered hills, it felt as if I had stepped right into one of those adverts. As we strolled through the buzzing little market that was happening in town, I spent half an eternity at a stall selling colorful handmade capiruchos, a popular toy in the form of a little wooden cup, tethered to a stick by a string. Three or four locals demonstrated the game (the goal is to flip the cup up into the air and catch it with the end of the stick). They say those who make a skill look easy show true mastery. Alas, I failed spectacularly and instead resorted to watching the experts while capturing the scene. When I pulled out my phone, I caught Sara smiling from beside me. ‚ÄúYou know, before the new government, this would‚Äôve made you a target,‚Äù she said, leisurely pointing at my bright-red flip cover. ‚ÄúWalking with my phone in my hand?‚Äù ‚ÄúYep. Also, wearing branded clothes, like those.‚Äù Her gaze fell onto my worn Nike sneakers, and I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach. I had spent a considerable amount of time living in places where you‚Äôd generally be advised to always keep a hand on your bag, just in case. But recalling the stories I had heard from Salvadorans about the state of things ‚Äúbefore the new government,‚Äù I began to slowly realize just how different life had been here just a couple of years prior. ‚ÄúThings are a lot better with the new government,‚Äù Sara told me. ‚ÄúSure, not everything is perfect. But we understand there are things that can‚Äôt be fixed in five years‚Äô time.‚Äù‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe healthcare system,‚Äù she replied instantly, ‚Äúas well as job opportunities for young graduates. Also, real estate prices.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre happy that people are coming to El Salvador to invest, and that the diaspora is returning. But housing prices have gone through the roof.‚Äù If you bought property in El Salvador two or three years ago, hats off to you. Prices have gone parabolic (sorry Bitcoin). This is also reflected in rent prices, so if you‚Äôre looking to relocate anytime soon, be prepared. These are growing pains, and so wherever you go, you‚Äôll see houses, condos, and also malls and recreational facilities being built. Meanwhile, you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find anyone who has something negative to say about the current administration. In fact, it happens on the regular that people will start proudly talking about ‚Äúthe new government‚Äù without so much as a prompt, out of an inherent urge to remind you of this timestamp in their most recent history. It‚Äôs rather unusual not to hate your government these days, and so I wouldn‚Äôt blame you if your initial reaction here was to raise an eyebrow or two. Yet if I‚Äôve learnt one thing since coming here, it is that the divide between headlines about El Salvador and the reality within El Salvador borders on sheer absurdity. A good proportion of the coverage you see makes for beautifully ornate works of fiction. El Presidente\n\nSo, who is this ‚Äúnew government,‚Äù and is it in the room with us right now? In 2019, Nayib Bukele won the presidential elections with 53% of the vote, shattering decades of de-facto bipartisanship. Five years later, his approval rate stands at over 90%. I know that seems hard to believe, given all the headlines about the draconian iron fist of the ‚Äúmillennial dictator.‚Äù While in our circles, we know him for playing out nation state-level game theory in the grand Bitcoin adoption scheme, throughout Latin America, much of his popularity stems from how he essentially turned his country upside down‚Äîor downside up‚Äîby stamping out long years of gang tyranny and bringing security to the streets, homes, and businesses of El Salvador. He did so at an unprecedented speed, all while letting his people and the rest of the world take part in the process every step of the way, broadcasting his campaigns and policies to Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram. But, but, presidents aren‚Äôt supposed to be familiar with the internet! They‚Äôre meant to be boomers whose interns generate a Tweet for them every two days via a poorly authored ChatGPT prompt. In a complete departure from what we know of our politicians, Nayib shows up in unicolor sweaters, jeans, and sneakers. He likes Marvel and Star Wars, quotes Napoleon and Alexander the Great, routinely sub-Tweets the powers that be, and when I met him, the first thing I thought was, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs way too human to be a politician.‚Äù Which, if modern politics is any indicator, would be an oxymoron. You can be human, or you can be a politician. God forbid you try to be both. Strategically placed narratives have sold us the idea that politicians who haven‚Äôt lost touch with reality pose a bigger threat than the puppet string-attached suits that dominate today‚Äôs world stage. But it isn‚Äôt just the fact that he knows how to use a smartphone which sets the president of El Salvador apart from many of his fellow heads of state. What tends to throw people off is, simply put, that he utilizes common sense, ‚Äúwhich is not that common,‚Äù as he would say. What helped him to the presidency was his focus on the silent majority of non-voters and those who felt represented by neither ARENA nor the FMLN, the two behemoth parties that had dominated Salvadoran politics since the end of the civil war. The parties had aged, as had their politics, and instead of votes, they had been collecting corruption charges. Bukele sought change, with an urgency at that. He focused on slashing crime and corruption and began promoting a revitalized national identity, a sense of pride among the people for being from El Salvador, no longer the land of war and gangs, but now the land of surf, volcanos, and financial freedom. It is challenging enough to turn your nation around and relieve it from its tragic title of ‚Äúmost dangerous country in the world.‚Äù But as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, faint cries sound from shaky ivory towers, an ocean away. It‚Äôs a sound bitcoiners are very familiar with‚Äîthe roar of ‚Äúleading‚Äù legacy media writing their fingers to the bone in their pursuit to outdo each other in the latest sensational narrative fabrication. With the skeletal digits of an aging colonizer, so-called superpowers descend upon the small Latin American nation, chanting their favorite buzzword ‚Äúdemocratic backsliding‚Äù while pulling the curtain over the dumpster fire in their very own backyard. This condescending attitude makes a mockery of every single party involved and achieves absolutely nothing even remotely of value. I am really very sick of it. El Salvador‚Äôs approach to eradicating crime and corruption is extreme. But you don‚Äôt fight forest fires with a watering can. The citizens are overwhelmingly in favor of their administration‚Äôs policies, and the reason becomes clear when you listen to personal accounts of those who have lived in pre-Bukele El Salvador. Most Salvadorans have very personal experiences in the way organized crime affected them in the past. There are countless stories that will radically put many accusations into perspective‚Äîbut they are stories so horrible I cannot for the life of me type them out in this article. We can barge in with our Western magnifying glass and attack El Salvador‚Äôs measures all we want‚Äîas of today, I have not seen any viable suggestions as to how Bukele could‚Äôve better protected the honest people from the murderers. One would think El Salvador is long used to nosy neighbors, as the country has a long history with foreign meddling in its internal affairs, be it from nation states or inter-governmental organizations like the IMF or the UN. At the 2022 United States General Assembly, or UNGA for short, Bukele called this out. Nobody watches those speeches, so I transcribed a section of it for you, because it is worth reading: ‚ÄúI come from a people that is only the master of the smallest country on the American continent. And even this little dominion over this small parcel of land, barely visible on the map, is not respected by countries that have a great deal more territory than us, much more money, much more power, and that think‚Äîcorrectly‚Äîthat they are the masters of their country, but that think incorrectly that they are also the masters of ours. [‚Ä¶] While on paper we are free and sovereign and independent, we will not really be so until the powerful understand that we want to be their friends, that we admire them, that we respect them, that our doors are wide open to trade, for them to visit us, to build the best possible relations. But what they can‚Äôt do is come to our house to give orders. Not only because it‚Äôs our house, but because it makes no sense to undo what we‚Äôre doing, what we‚Äôre achieving.‚Äú Earlier this month, Bukele reiterated his stance: no more foreign intrusion in national matters. This has further boosted his popularity, even with the notorious meddler that is the United States. Bukele‚Äôs rising reputation among U.S. citizens is striking, and even the U.S. government has long realized it can‚Äôt afford to burn bridges with the most popular president in Latin America, and possibly beyond. You can tell very clearly whose side I‚Äôm on. I never much enjoyed talking about politics, for two reasons: firstly, politics divides people, ironically. Secondly, I never felt represented by the public servants who so often tended to serve themselves first. In El Salvador, I see a reversal of both trends. Is everything rainbows and butterflies? Of course not. It‚Äôs still politics. At the end of the day, you pick the lesser evil, which for me happens to be under a ‚Äúmillennial dictatorship.‚Äù \n\nAbout BitcoinSo I‚Äôm two thirds into this article and only now starting to talk about Bitcoin. That‚Äôs intentional. Out of all things intriguing about El Salvador, Bitcoin is not at the top of my list. Bitcoin is not the be-all and end-all of El Salvador‚Äôs charm. It fits right into the picture of a country that likes to swim against the current. It‚Äôs a perfect indicator of low-time preference leadership. But it is not what ‚Äúmakes‚Äù El Salvador. Here, everybody knows about Bitcoin. Depending on where you go, you‚Äôll be able to pay with bitcoin, and I‚Äôve met several people who live their lives entirely on sats. Down in El Zonte, the Bitcoin Beach initiative has created a little Bitcoin haven. The municipality of Berlin has its own growing Bitcoin circular economy. In the mountainous forests, coffee farmers get paid via Lightning. In the capital, while less present, you will still be able to pay with bitcoin here and there. You can see a clear trend, but the reality is that the majority of the Salvadoran population uses the dollar for payments, not bitcoin. Does that mean the ‚ÄúBitcoin experiment‚Äù (thanks for the term, legacy media) has failed? Of course not. When I first read that accepting bitcoin would be made compulsory, it left me with a funny feeling. This is not the way. Live and let live. Offer the choice, don‚Äôt force the solution. If this was how it would be done, I feared it wouldn‚Äôt be sustainable, especially in light of the ensuing bear market that, perfectly timed by the Universe (or certain over-leveraged industry companies), kicked off shortly after the Bitcoin Law went into effect. Fast-forward to today, I can‚Äôt use bitcoin as much as I would like. I would‚Äôve loved to pay for my hotel stay in bitcoin, but the hotel couldn‚Äôt find its POS device. I‚Äôd love to pay my rent in bitcoin, but my landlord thought otherwise. I‚Äôd love to pay the customs office‚Äîwell, I‚Äôm not sure I would love to pay them, but if I have to, I would like to do it in bitcoin. That didn‚Äôt happen either. Sure, I‚Äôd like more options to pay in bitcoin. But I‚Äôm way happier to see that the ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù part of the law is not being enforced. Bitcoin is an option here, an offer for the population to make use of‚Äîor not. Surely price action contributes its fair share to the general interest of the population, much like in the rest of the world. The difference between El Salvador and many other countries is that once said interest returns, which it will, the infrastructure will be there to welcome it. Merchants will have their payment terminals, individuals will have their wallets, the school system will have Bitcoin education, and the country will once again step into the limelight as the one who kicked off nation-state adoption; a title that can‚Äôt be taken away. There‚Äôs even an actual Bitcoin Office here, run by Stacy Herbert and Max Keiser, who were among the first bitcoiners to relocate and have since been championing various programs to further establish Bitcoin in the country. To help move things along, there are various other private initiatives run by a fast-growing community, and by now, many bitcoiners have found a new home here. To them, Bitcoin is the gateway drug to a country that ticks many more boxes than just the orange one, especially when the state of the world out there has them scratching their heads. For bitcoiners, the Bitcoin Law brought a harbor for our lifeboats. For El Salvador, it brought investment, tourism, and attention. Of course, lots of that attention was negative for the longest time and often still continues to be, but El Salvador‚Äôs show of low-time preference is due to pay off big time, in due time. First movers have it the hardest, but they reap the biggest rewards. The same goes for the personal decision to exit the status quo and opt into an alternative to Big Brother. Wen El Salvador?A fifty-minute drive from San Salvador, the air is sticky with humidity, and buzzing traffic noise is swapped out for the humming of powerful waves washing up on the pebbly beaches of El Zonte. It‚Äôs the birthplace of Bitcoin Beach, the grassroots movement that inspired the nation. Every month, Bitcoin Beach organizes a meetup at Palo Verde, a cozy boutique hotel by the beach. Anyone can join, and every time I‚Äôve attended, the place was packed. During the event, Roman Martinez, one of the brains behind Bitcoin Beach, invites locals and expats onto a small stage nestled in between the pool and the restaurant where they talk about their projects, from grass-fed beef subscriptions and real estate companies to educational ventures and plushies (that‚Äôs me). Sometimes, an excited guest will grab the mic and report on their personal experience living in El Salvador. Other times, a spontaneous panel will form, and attendees will discuss new potential startups to pursue in Bitcoin Country. There is an energy second to none. Again, you have to see it to believe it. \n\nMoving countries is a huge endeavor, and the real challenge starts after you have completed the literal relocating part. A different culture, a different language, a different climate, a different environment, a different lifestyle, a different community, and so on and so forth. Numerous factors play into whether your move to a new country will fulfill you, first and foremost your own willingness to step way outside of your comfort zone. What you get in return here in El Salvador is a country with breathtaking sceneries, stunning nature, mountains, beaches, and lakes, and beautiful weather all-year round. You get a country that doesn‚Äôt give you the side-eye for being a bitcoiner (which is hard to come by). But most of all, you get a country whose people radiate optimism, and who look towards their future with joy and ambition, an attitude that is 100% infectious. You get a country in upswing, and you can see, hear, and feel it. You‚Äôll likely think this sounds cheesy; so even though I just served you a spirited 3,500-word pitch for El Salvador‚Äîdon‚Äôt trust, verify. It can‚Äôt hurt to take a look. Just don‚Äôt wait a year and a half like I did. On that one, you can trust me.¬†This is a guest post by Lina Seiche.

        "content": "Consider a doomsday scenario. You spend the past couple years diligently dollar cost averaging and withdrawing to your wallet. You have a ton of small UTXO1‚Äòs and bitcoin transaction fees rise so much that your bitcoin turns into dust2. You‚Äôre now unable to spend your bitcoin. For some bitcoin users, this is not a doomsday scenario, this is a reality that they experienced over the past 6 months.During 2023 we saw very big fluctuations in bitcoin transaction fees as Ordinals3 brought a flood of new bitcoin users and with that significant increase in blockspace demand. Despite the positive press from the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval, users have faced serious challenges from high transaction fees, especially for users who have small UTXO‚Äôs. In some cases, UTXO‚Äôs were unspendable, also known as turned into dust. This transaction fee pain led many people to ask the question, how can I know if my UTXO‚Äôs are at risk? For this article, we will explore the point at which dust is created and try to help lay out a minimum plan to mitigate this risk. Bitcoin Median Transaction Fees In sat/vB Past 6 Months\n\nSource: Dune as of January 12, 2024\nOver the past 6 months we have seen wild swings in median bitcoin transaction fees. We saw mempools clear with 0 sat/vB and soar higher than 350 sat/vB. While that might not mean much to you at face value, it can mean big challenges for users who are sending multiple small value SegWit UTXO‚Äôs in single transactions. In fact, some users saw their UTXO‚Äôs turn into dust. This obviously caused panic, and for some this caused an expensive lesson in UTXO management. This is not an article that explains UTXO management strategy, this article attempts to tell you that you absolutely want big UTXO‚Äôs. If bitcoin does what we think it is going to do, then multiple UTXO transactions as small as 0.001 BTC could be unspendable under high fee environments, and you can kiss your dust goodbye.Before we jump into the data, we need to define what we want to look at. For us we are trying to understand if a UTXO is spendable or it is dust (non spendable). For this we will need the following:Sum of UTXO‚Äôs being sentTotal Weight Units4Transaction fee sats/vBWith this information we can make a formula that shows how much value is transferred in a bitcoin transaction after you remove the transaction fees.Transferred Value = BTC Sent - ( ( ( Total Weight Units / 4 ) * Transaction Fee in sats/vB ) * 0.00000001 )If the transferred value is a negative number, this means you have dust, the UTXO sum costs more to send than it is worth. Because calculating bitcoin transaction weight units is a bit complex, we will use a realistic scenario for use in building our table, assumptions, and recommendations.For this example we are using5 basic SegWit (P2WPKH) financial transactions with the following weight units:Single-input, single output, single signature, single pubkey, SegWit transaction (P2WPKH script)total weight units would be approximately 440 weight units.5 inputs, single output, single signature, single pubkey SegWit transaction (P2WPKH script) total weight units would be approximately 1,528 weight units.Using our formula above and the SegWit transaction with (5) inputs weighing 1,528 weight units, we built the following dust table.Dust Table\n\nDust Table calculated at 1,528 weight units per the5 SegWit inputs example above.The Dust Table reveals some telling information. Dust is real, and the threshold is lower than I imagined. As transaction fees continue to rise, larger valued UTXO‚Äôs become more at risk. During the peak transaction fee times over the past month, our example transaction would be dust even for .001 BTC. That‚Äôs a little less than $50 at current market conditions. This feels incredible. 100,000 sats suddenly turned into dust. Gone. Unusable. This is terrifying.While this example scenario does not affect all users, the lesson is very clear, make big UTXO‚Äôs! For long term storage you must not keep UTXO‚Äôs smaller than 0.01 BTC. We saw 300+ sat/vB fees last year and that will increasingly become the norm. In that fee market, multi UTXO transactions smaller than .001 are dust. Don‚Äôt be that guy.Dust may be an afterthought for you today, we are blessed with returns to sub 50 sat/vB fees, but dust could become a costly problem for you in the future if not managed today. By understanding the relationship between UTXO weight units and transaction fees, we gain valuable insights into the lower bound sizes for UTXOs.Dust ExtremesModeling out the dust threshold for UTXOs is an interesting experiment because it shows you how crazy things have to get and at what point BTC becomes dust. For the table below, we are using the same data as outlined above, that is a 5 input SegWit transaction with 1,528 weight units. This table illustrates the fee rate at which a BTC amount being sent in a 1,528 weight unit transaction will turn into dust.Signing A UTXOAnother key finding in all this research is the cost of signing a single standard (P2PKH) UTXO. This is an extreme on the small side because it is one of the smallest transactions you can make. For this example we want to use the standard script (non-segwit) because it is the heaviest of the script types. Here are the specifics:Standard (P2PKH) Script Type1 input1 Pubkey0 Outputs632 weight unitsSigning Economics Economics of signing a single standard UTXO with one signature, one pubkey, and 0 outputs weighing 632 weight units.With this information you can understand the minimum cost of making Bitcoin transactions. Key TakeawaysDust threshold is lower than you think, especially in high transaction fee marketsWhen withdrawing BTC from exchanges consider waiting until your balance is ‚â• 0.01 before sending to your storage.If you have many small(< 0.001 BTC) UTXO, you must consolidate them into larger UTXOs while fees are low.You don‚Äôt have a crystal ball, and there are only so many things in your control. BTC price, blockspace demand, hashprice, hashrate, and bitcoin in general are out of your control. You have control over your keys, and the best thing you can do is be prepared for the inevitable high fee market. It will happen or Bitcoin will fail, I don‚Äôt make the rules. Do not let your precious bitcoin turn into dust. Remember this, if you do nothing then to dust you shall return.By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust and to dust you shall return.-Genesis 3:19FOOTNOTESUTXO (Unspent Transaction Output): [n.]A component of a Bitcoin transaction that represents an amount of digital currency not yet spent and available for future transactions.The output of a blockchain transaction that can be used as an input in a new transaction, signifying the amount of cryptocurrency remaining after the transaction is executed. ‚Ü©Ô∏éIn the Bitcoin protocol, dust refers to small amounts of currency that are lower than the fee required to spend them in a transaction.

        "content": "So, 2023 has been pretty epic for Bitcoin. It's like Bitcoin woke up and decided to flex its muscles big time. We're talking a massive leap, over 140% in value ‚Äì that's huge! It's not just about topping traditional rivals like gold; it's also about leaving other cryptocurrencies in the rearview mirror. Let‚Äôs dive into the on-chain action and the exchange buzz, trying to piece together clues to see what Bitcoin might be up to in the coming year. Bitcoin's Blast from the PastAccording to Glassnode's report, we‚Äôre seeing a d√©j√† vu with Bitcoin cycles in 2015-2017 and 2018-2022 in terms of how long it's taking to bounce back and the drawdown since the all-time high (ATH).\n\nSource: Glassnode\nIn the current cycle, Bitcoin has seen a drawdown of about -37% from its ATH, which is pretty close to the -42% in 2013-2017 and -39% in 2017-2021. Plus, since the FTX lows in November 2022, Bitcoin prices are up a solid +140%, making it the strongest one-year return compared to the +119% in 2015-2018 and +128% in 2018-2022.Exchange Activity: Bitcoin's Trading ParadoxDespite 2023 being a banner year for Bitcoin, the number of transactions depositing funds to exchanges has surprisingly hit multi-year lows. But here's the kicker: Glassnode data shows that the on-chain volume flowing in and out of exchanges has skyrocketed, jumping from $930 million to a staggering $3 billion ‚Äì that's a massive 220% increase.This discrepancy between fewer deposits yet skyrocketing volume makes us wonder: what's driving the intensified exchange activity if not retail investors? On one hand, the decrease in deposit transactions might suggest that investors are becoming more cautious about leaving their assets on exchanges, possibly due to security concerns or a desire for greater control over their funds. This is where the potential shift towards non-custodial exchanges like StealthEX comes into play. Given the FTX drama that's still on everyone's mind, it's no surprise that these platforms where you can keep your private keys are becoming more popular. There's a serious uptick in on-chain volume showing that trading and speculation are buzzing more than ever. It seems that while investors might be shying away from depositing their funds, they are actively trading and moving large sums of money. This could be a sign of growing institutional interest, especially as we see the average size of deposits to exchanges nearing the previous all-time high of $30k per deposit, according to Glassnode. Moreover, the fact that exchange deposits as a percentage of all transactions have dropped from around 26% in May to just 10% today, yet the decline is more modest (around 20%) when adjusted for Inscriptions, adds another layer to this narrative. Undeniably, we're witnessing a dynamic shift in the blockchain sphere as novel transaction types emerge and new players grab their share of the limelight.Short-Term Holders Cashing InShort-Term Holders (STHs) have been making some smart moves lately, cashing in on their Bitcoin investments at just the right time. Glassnode's got the stats to prove it ‚Äì the STH-Supply Profit/Loss Ratio has been hovering above ~1 since January. This means these savvy traders have been playing the 'buy-the-dip' game pretty well, a classic move in uptrends. However, these STHs are moving hefty amounts of coins to exchanges, and the gap between what they paid and what they're selling for is pretty sizable.\n\nSource: Glassnode\nThe first week of December, when Bitcoin hit $44.2k, STHs jumped into action, seizing the moment to take profits. It's like they saw the wave coming and rode it all the way to the shore, capitalizing on the demand liquidity. This activity has put a bit of a pause on Bitcoin's upward climb, demonstrating STHs‚Äô sway over crypto prices.Wrapping It Up: Bitcoin and BeyondSo, there you have it ‚Äì Bitcoin's 2023 story is a mix of triumphs, challenges, and a whole lot of excitement. Bitcoin, in its digital universe, never fails to keep us intrigued with its roller-coaster ride of strong recoveries and declines that resonate with historical patterns, even bouncing back recently despite a few bumps on the road. The play of STHs and the unpredictable ebbs and flows of exchange activities knit together a complex, yet intriguing narrative. Regardless of whether you're in it for the highs or the lows, or simply out of sheer curiosity, observing Bitcoin's ride is undoubtedly one to watch.¬†This is a guest post by Maria Carola.

It is common knowledge among native Texans that nothing should ever be done to jeopardize their ownership rights. ‚ÄúNever sell your mineral rights‚Äù is a commonly heard expression for Texas natives.The reason generations of Texans have kept their mineral rights intact within their families is that the modern global economy rests almost entirely upon the benefits of the extraction, refining, and processing of these subsurface minerals. When you own mineral rights, you own the fundamental primary material that allows the production and distribution of nearly all of the goods and services our civilization enjoys. In the future, the world‚Äôs economic production will similarly rely on Bitcoin to coordinate large transactions between manufacturers and industrial firms.Texas Mineral RightsMineral rights represent ownership of subsurface materials and the right to sell, develop, and produce those materials. Texans have been fortunate to have the right to access the valuable mineral and hydrocarbon reserves located beneath their properties for more than 150 years. Mineral owners can track ownership through legal records dating back to the 1866 state constitution of Texas, which was formed to meet the requirements to reenter the United States after seceding five years earlier and which firmly established privately held mineral rights.It is essential to understand that mineral rights in Texas can, and predominantly are at this point, severed from the rights of ownership of the land surface. These two distinct property rights are often referred to as the mineral estate and the surface estate. In addition to the ability to separate the mineral estate from the surface estate, the mineral estate can be subdivided into fractional shares of ownership. In Texas, it is commonplace for mineral estates to be divided into tiny fractional ownership shares. Whether the same owner holds the mineral ownership and surface ownership or they have been separated sometime in the past, according to Texas law, the mineral estate holds a position of supremacy over the surface estate. This authority allows the mineral rights owner to use the land's surface to explore, develop, and produce oil and gas under the property. The mineral rights holder usually accomplishes this by entering into a contract (mineral lease agreement) with a specialized company to explore and extract resources from the property in exchange for a lump sum payment followed by ongoing royalty payments that result from selling the resources to the market.4 Pillars Of Modern SocietyThe standard of living in our modern society would not be possible without the massive widespread use of fossil fuels extracted from below the earth‚Äôs surface. In his book ‚ÄúHow the World Really Works,‚Äù author Vaclav Smil masterfully explores our total dependence on fossil fuels to provide four indispensable materials our civilization relies upon. These fundamentally essential materials are cement, steel, plastics, and ammonia.Approximately 17% of the world‚Äôs energy supply is needed to produce these four critical materials. Your ability to use the internet and every connected device ultimately depends on fossil fuel hydrocarbons. The infrastructure and technologies of the modern world are only possible through their use, and they are the sole means to provide food for 4 billion people. In his book, Smil explains the crucial role each of these materials plays in the function of our global economy. Their production heavily relies on fossil fuels with no other viable energy substitutes. Smil reports that the global annual production of cement is 4.5 billion tons, steel is 1.8 billion tons, plastics are nearly 400 million tons, and ammonia is 180 million tons.Currently, there are no feasible alternatives to using steel or cement to construct the world's infrastructure. Their combination of strength, durability, and adaptability is unmatched by any other materials. The production of cement and steel requires intense heat, which is currently only possible by way of the combustion of fossil fuels. Replacing the aging infrastructure of developed countries and building new infrastructure in underdeveloped nations will require continual vast amounts of new cement and steel production.Not only do ammonia and plastics require a large amount of energy in production, but they also are formed using hydrocarbon-derived inputs. 50% of worldwide food production relies on ammonia fertilizer, produced using hydrogen that is sourced from natural gas. Natural gas is also the energy source that provides the high pressure and temperatures required for the process.Over 99% of plastics are derived from the refining of fossil fuel hydrocarbons. No alternative material offers the same extensive benefits of plastic‚Äôs light weight, flexibility, durability, and usefulness. The world enjoys countless products that contain plastics, such as automobile and appliance parts, consumer electronics, food packaging, furniture, and life-saving medical equipment found in hospitals. Petroleum refining also provides critical elements such as adhesives, engine lubricants, detergents, coolants, inks, pharmaceuticals, coatings, and textiles.Eliminating fossil fuels from the global energy supply in the next few decades is an unrealistic goal when we honestly consider the available data. Due to our physical and real-world constraints, the transition to a decarbonized, renewable energy-driven economy poses a nearly insurmountable challenge.Hydrocarbon minerals play a prominent role in the beginning stages of mass-scale modern production, and the transport of final goods depends almost entirely on hydrocarbon fuels. Tracing the stages of production processes backward from the final stage of consumer goods and services to the original input of fossil fuel hydrocarbons, we find that the ownership of mineral rights at the first stage of production signifies a pivotal position of influence over the economic landscape. This position grants mineral rights owners the immense power to shape and dictate economic destiny for every individual, business, and nation. Our global economy rests upon mineral rights owners' discretion to allow their property to be utilized.Just as owning mineral rights is owning the base material that underpins the functioning of the entire global economy, owning bitcoin today is owning the mineral rights to the future economy. The worldwide economy will one day function through the exchange of bitcoin between productive entities. Those who own bitcoin will own the financial collateral that allows the economy to function and transact.Bitcoin And Mineral RightsBitcoin and mineral rights may seem like disparate concepts, but share some similarities. Both are subject to the concept of limited supply. In the case of Bitcoin, there will only ever be 21 million coins in existence due to its programmed scarcity. Similarly, mineral rights pertain to owning scarce mineral resources found underground. Both Bitcoin and mineral rights have forms of ownership, meaning both can be bought, sold, or transferred to others. The value of each asset is determined by market demand and supply dynamics, and each has experienced significant price fluctuations over time. Both mineral rights and Bitcoin share the feature of being decentralized. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, with no single entity controlling its issuance or transactions. Likewise, mineral rights represent ownership of an asset found across the globe without a centralized issuer. Each asset also has a substantial cost to its extraction and release into the arena of human economic activity. Oil and gas extraction from underground requires significant investments of financial capital, labor, and energy. Generating new supply in the Bitcoin network also requires considerable energy expenditures and capital investments in physical hardware and infrastructure.The scarcity of bitcoin derives from its programmed 21 million supply cap, but bitcoin scarcity also develops because of its relative relationship with the entirety of the world‚Äôs goods and services. As the nominal amount of goods and services grows at a rate higher than the rate of supply of new bitcoin, bitcoin becomes more scarce relative to these goods and services because it grows more slowly. This relative aspect of Bitcoin to our economy creates a second layer of scarcity beyond the programmed supply limit of 21 million. As this second layer of scarcity grows over time due to the network effects of an expanding economy, other forms of storing value become perpetually inferior to this better store of value.The price of everything in terms of bitcoin is always trending downward, making it a better way to preserve capital than other forms. For example, new industrial building construction costs have increased by 46% in the past five years, meaning an industrial capital project that cost $100 million five years ago might cost $146 million today. However, when priced in Bitcoin terms, the cost for this project has reduced by nearly 90%, from 26,253 BTC five years ago to 3,395 BTC today. As the world continues to become more productive, the value of those productivity gains is stored in the most dominant store of value. That store of value is Bitcoin, and as global market participants increasingly understand this, the value of Bitcoin will trend upward forever.Within the domain of current Bitcoin commentary, it is common to hear or read about a future where merchants will sell their goods in exchange for payment by Bitcoin or other related applications functioning on top of the Bitcoin network. Retail merchant adoption will undoubtedly help build Bitcoin demand and incrementally enlarge the network‚Äôs value. However, the most considerable impact on the growth of bitcoin demand will arrive when the owners of the world‚Äôs factors of production begin to demand bitcoin as payment for their goods.Bitcoin And ProductionFirms participating in the various stages of productive processes will start to understand the economic phenomenon of holding cash balances that increase in value while simply holding them, and therefore, will begin to demand bitcoin. Cash balances that accrete value instead of declining in value over time simplify financial planning for large capital expenditures. Significant capital investments in new projects become more manageable to facilitate. Businesses can finance capital projects more efficiently using their cash reserves held in Bitcoin rather than relying on debt or equity financing that dilutes shareholder value. Financial officers managing a company's capital structure will break into a new era of corporate finance when they begin calculating the net present value of an investment made with money that appreciates in value over time instead of depreciating.When a firm chooses to invest in productive endeavors, the firm does so in anticipation of earning a resulting return of greater value. When a company uses accumulated Bitcoin to fund a capital project, it will consequently only accept Bitcoin as a return on investment. Accepting an inferior form of money in return will be unacceptable. As manufacturing and production businesses increasingly adopt Bitcoin as a medium for coordinating exchanges of value in manufacturing processes, the Bitcoin network will absorb significant amounts of value from the existing monetary system. This process will create a circular exchange, strengthening Bitcoin's store of value characteristic and increasing demand among companies supplying production factors throughout supply chains.When the use of Bitcoin to facilitate large value exchanges between businesses becomes widespread, the availability of Bitcoin in the market will become limited. At that point, the only way to acquire Bitcoin will be by providing something of value in return. Purchasing Bitcoin with other forms of currency from a money exchange will become rare, and those who wish to obtain Bitcoin will instead have to earn it. Bitcoin will become all but unavailable for purchase through traditional means.There will be a day when the producers of capital-intensive goods and scarce natural resources stop accepting continually and purposefully diluted money for their products. In the future, when large payments of value between manufacturers and industrial firms are made through Bitcoin, the worldwide economy will become dependent on it to function. Those who have accumulated bitcoin in advance of this will find themselves in a position of dominance. Just as the owners of subsurface mineral rights today profit by allowing their property to be utilized to power the global economy, bitcoin owners will one day profit by administering the money that coordinates worldwide economic production.Owning Bitcoin today is owning the mineral rights to the future.This is a guest post by Aaron Roberts.

        "summary": "Chinese investors are in panic mode as their stock markets crash. Some are turning to bitcoin‚Äôs store-of-value and exciting investment thesis.",
        "content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nLast week, I put the massive buying pressure coming to bitcoin in context, but there is another ‚Äî perhaps the largest ‚Äî source of potential demand entering the scene. We already know the Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy issuing more shares to buy more bitcoin, Tether‚Äôs constant buying, and the halving will all be major sources of demand this cycle. For example, in the first two weeks of trading alone, the ‚Äúnewborn 9‚Äù accumulated 125,000 BTC. That has, so far, been offset by GBTC outflows, but it is unlikely that all GBTC holders are captive sellers who will get out ASAP. This outflow should start to wane in the coming weeks.A somewhat unexpected development is emerging in China of all places. Readers of my content here and on bitcoinandmarkets.com won‚Äôt be strangers to what‚Äôs happening in China over the past couple of years. They are experiencing the end-of-an-economic-model transition. The China we have grown to know was built on debt, producing goods for over-indebted foreign customers. They are heavily dependent on globalization and a highly elastic monetary environment. That era is coming to an end, and the crash of the Chinese real estate market, and now their stock market, are visible signs of the end of that paradigm.\n\nSource: @Schuldensuehner\nOn January 24, China Asset Management Company (China AMC), a gigantic fund manager and ETF provider in China, halted trading on their Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 ETFs to stop the flood of money out of other funds and into these US-connected funds. On Tuesday, other US-connected ETFs on Chinese markets opened limit up, and had a 21% premium over NAV. The flight to safety is also affecting Chinese-based Japanese ETFs. Tuesday saw the China AMC‚Äôs Nomura Nikkei 225 ETF rise over 6% to a 22% premium.\n\nSource: @Sino_Market\nChinese investors are in full-on panic mode, and the authorities are barring the door. It is only a matter of time until more Chinese investors start tapping bitcoin for its store-of-value and portability. Many Chinese are already familiar with bitcoin. China used to be a dominant source of demand for bitcoin until the CCP banned it in 2021.While bitcoin is still officially banned in Mainland China, investors can still use exchanges like Binance and OKX. They can also buy OTC, person-to-person, or via off-shore bank accounts. Last year, Hong Kong very publicly opened back up to bitcoin. They have been following in lockstep behind US regulators giving Bitcoin the official blessing in Hong Kong. It is unlikely that Hong Kong authorities would make such a public push for legalizing bitcoin only to turn around the next year to ban it. This morning, a piece from Reuters quotes a senior executive of a Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange, who confirms this capital flight story. ‚ÄúInvestment on the mainland [is] risky, uncertain and disappointing, so people are looking to allocate assets offshore. [...] Almost everyday, we see mainland investors coming into this market.‚Äù The source added, ‚ÄúIf you are a Chinese brokerage, facing a sluggish stock market, weak demand for IPOs, and shrinkage in other businesses, you need a growth story to tell your shareholders and the board.‚Äù\n\nSource: Reuters\nWe have been talking about Bitcoin providing a parallel world of green shoots, and now it is being recognized everywhere.The flows from China will be a big source of demand in this cycle, and the approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in the US will create a perfect synergy via allowing sophisticated foreign investors to buy bitcoin and US-based assets at the same time.We cannot forget about the faltering European markets either. Europe is likely already in recession. By December, EU factory activity had contracted for 18 straight months. Germany barely avoided a technical recession despite 2023 GDP being negative at -0.2%. The relative attractiveness of bitcoin is very high in a world of capital flight and negative growth. Many bitcoiners are worried about a recession bringing a stock market crash, which would force selling of bitcoin like it did in March 2020, but it might be the opposite this time around. As investors realize that the old system is stagnant and decaying, Bitcoin‚Äôs unique convergence of properties as revolutionary tech, a fixed supply asset, and economic growth potential will be where capital flees into.Bitcoin Price UpdateBitcoin‚Äôs price performance has been disappointing since the ETF launch. However, in the context of FTX receivership selling $1 billion worth of GBTC and other large entities selling GBTC to rotate into lower capital fees of the new ETFs, price has held up extremely well.RSI is one of the most widely used indicators and, as such, has a Schelling point effect. People and bots are watching for the daily RSI to hit oversold. Therefore, it is likely we won‚Äôt see any significant upside in price until 30 on the RSI is broken. That can be achieved by one more sell-off into support, since we are so close to 30 already. A more unlikely possibility is we could form a hidden bullish divergence, where the price makes slightly higher lows, but the RSI makes lower lows. I do not expect any significant downside either with the confluence of demand described above:we are at a temporary stalemate.\n\nStaying on the daily chart below but zooming in, we see the 100 DMA is providing support currently. I also am watching the $37,877 level; an important price from back in November. Any dip that pushes RSI to oversold might not close below that. \n\nThe 100-day typically does not provide much support in bitcoin, with the 50- and 200-day moving averages being the most influential. However, below I show September 2020, right before the monster bull rally to end that year. The 100-day was the star back then. It is possible to hold along the 100-day and then rally with a pause in GBTC selling. Another interesting note from that period in 2020: the RSI stopped shy of oversold, catching many off guard as it shot to the moon. That is not my base case, but it does have precedence.\n\nBottom line, we are seeing massive and new sources of demand for bitcoin from the ETFs and now China capital flight. The ETF launch dynamics have been complicated but price has been relatively steady all things considered. It is only a matter of time until demand becomes apparent in price.",

        "title": "Bitcoin Is Pure Anarchy",
        "summary": "Bitcoin's \"governance\" process is defined literally and succinctly by a single word: anarchy. It is literally impossible for a voluntary and distributed system to be \"governed\" in any other way.",
        "content": "Anarchy is a very dividing word to many people, inherently drawing the idea into peoples‚Äô heads of complete and unbridled chaos. This is not on any level what Anarchy means. It is simply a system lacking rulers or a central authority, where all cooperation and coordination is done on a purely voluntary basis between peers in the system. The etymology of the original Greek word, anarhkia, itself literally just means ‚Äúwithout rulers.‚Äù An, meaning without, arkhia, meaning rulers. This concept is the foundational reality of why Bitcoin functions as a distributed network and protocol. There is literally no one in charge of the network. If there were, then it would not be a distributed system composed of sovereign individuals voluntarily choosing to interact with each other. People tend to look at Bitcoin as some objective truth that functions as a frame of reference for human beings, that it exists in the same sense as the laws of physics. That is not true. This notion confuses the borders between objectivity, intersubjectivity, and subjectivity. An objective truth is one that exists regardless of peoples‚Äô subjective belief in it. I.e. The laws of gravity mean that an object with enough mass will exert its gravitational influence over all other objects around it. No amount of refusal to believe in this fact of the universe will change it. You can convince the entire human race to the last man, woman, and child, that the laws of gravity in fact do not exist. This will not stop gravity from exerting its influence on all of them. Now take for instance the value of the dollar. Is the dollar inherently valuable? Is that an objective statement of truth? It is not. The only reason the dollar has value to any individual is because they subjectively value it. Why does an individual subjectively value the dollar? Because other individuals also subjectively value the dollar. This is intersubjectivity. It is simply a subjective viewpoint shared amongst a large number of individuals. That is what Bitcoin is, a distributed intersubjective system. So what is the difference between Bitcoin and the dollar? The lack of rulers and coercion. The dollar system has people in charge of it, the Federal Reserve, the commercial banks that actually issue new dollars by offering credit, the government agencies that regulate its use and who can interact with it. It has tax authorities mandating its use in the payment of your tax obligations. Bitcoin has no such equivalent rulers. It has no Federal Reserve board, it has no commercial banks that dictate when and in what quantities dollars are brought into circulation. It has no taxes that you are coerced into paying by anyone. It is simply a distributed set of economic actors voluntarily running a piece of code in order to interact with each other. ‚ÄúBut Bitcoin has rules.‚Äù Yes, it does. That people voluntarily opt into. There is no power structure or governance structure involved in creating those rules. They were put out into the world by Satoshi Nakamoto, and every single person who has joined the network since that moment in time freely chose to adopt those rules. There is no structure saying ‚Äúthese are the rules.‚Äù There is simply the set of rules that everyone has voluntarily chosen to follow completely of their own accord. Even changes to those rules that have occurred over the years, and there are quite a few of them, are purely voluntary in their nature. There was no governance structure or authority that imposed them on anyone. There are no ‚Äúrules to change the rules.‚Äù Anyone at any time can step up into the social square and propose a new rule to add to the Bitcoin protocol and network. At any time people can choose to adopt that new rule, and if a critical mass of people do so, then it is now a rule of the network. People often think that because the protocol and the network itself has rules, that there is some kind of framework of ‚Äúmeta rules‚Äù surrounding that. That these meta rules must be followed in order to change the rules of the system itself, or are some kind of binding requirement to fulfill some purpose or nature of the system that cannot be changed or evolve over time. This completely fails to internalize the reality of what an anarchic system actually is. There are no rules except what people choose to voluntarily follow of their own accord. Within the confines of those rules, it is anarchy. Anything anyone can voluntarily do in interaction with another person in the confines of those rules, is allowed. Even those rules themselves are simply the result of a consensus arrived at through a process of pure anarchy, i.e. people interacting voluntarily within the framework that they chose to. That is what it is, no matter how much you might want to twist and contort definitions in your head to fit some other framework. There is no authority to appeal to here. There are no rules to demand people follow other than the consensus rules themselves, and even that cannot be demanded or enforced. All you can do is hope that people choose to continue following them out of their own self interest. At any time a persuasive individual or group can convince others to change even those. If that occurs, there is nothing whatsoever you can do about it except attempt to be more persuasive. That is what anarchy is. Free association devoid of any type of authority, or coercion, or control over who other people associate with, or under what terms they choose to associate. Bitcoin is anarchy, and if that fact disturbs you or instinctually makes you want to argue against it, then the reality is you never understood Bitcoin in the first place.¬†",

        "summary": "Bitcoin is no longer the dominant cryptocurrency for black market activity. Policy makers need to adapt to this new reality.",
        "content": "Significant shifts are underway in the ecosystem of illicit actors using cryptocurrency. According to a 2023 report by TRM Labs, Bitcoin is no longer the asset of choice for criminals.The report states, ‚ÄúThe multi-chain era has had a sweeping impact on the distribution of illicit crypto volume as a whole, where Bitcoin‚Äôs share plummeted from 97% in 2016 to 19% in 2022. In 2016, two thirds of crypto hack volume was on Bitcoin; in 2022, it accounted for just under 3%, with Ethereum (68%) and Binance Smart Chain (19%) dominating the field. And while Bitcoin was the exclusive currency for terrorist financing in 2016, by 2022 it was all but replaced by assets on the TRON blockchain, with 92%.‚ÄùRamifications Of the ShiftClearly, this turns the adage of Bitcoin being synonymous with criminal activity, on its head.Since inception, Bitcoin has functioned as a Schelling Point due to its network effect, market dominance and liquidity, making it a natural choice in cryptofinance.(In Game Theory parlance, a Schelling Point is a natural solution in situations where multiple parties must make decisions without direct communication. These points are intuitively obvious, often relying on shared expectations or common knowledge.)However, now it seems that there is an ongoing separation of equilibria with bad actors opting for a different point of convergence.Policy TakeawaysThis move offers some key learnings from a policy perspective.It highlights the need for policymakers to closely study specific assets and blockchains that are currently being favored by illicit actors and take appropriate action. More importantly, it provides an opportune moment to replace the current, generic perspective on digital assets with a more nuanced one, while shaping policy narratives on criminal usage.Case in point, in the ongoing discussion on use of cryptoassets in terror financing, it often gets missed that Hamas has in fact stopped accepting Bitcoin donations, to protect its sponsors from being unveiled.But most importantly, this shift of illicit finance away from Bitcoin, is the first ever documented case of major crime displacement in the world of cryptoassets. It sheds light on the fluid nature of Financial Crime as it adapts to the path of least resistance.Perspectives From Game TheoryConsequently, a game-theoretic lens (with the players being - product devs, regulators, good and bad actors) enables a holistic and nuanced view of the space. We can see that in such a setting, interplay of independent actions and perspectives, generates myriad scenarios as the system is too intertwined for any set of players to control outcomes only by themselves.A game-theoretic view of illicit finance expounds the need to step into the criminal mind to predict next steps and prepare accordingly. Policy making to combat illegal fund flows, is typically retroactive with bad actors making the first few moves, which are then studied as emerging risks to accordingly craft regulations. However, with the space of digital assets evolving at an exponential pace, we do not have the luxury of following this whack-a-mole approach (which happens to be the norm in designing Traditional Finance regulations).The ongoing wave of crime displacement away from Bitcoin, highlights the necessity to arm policymakers with predictive systems that forecast future patterns of illicit fund flows. Such an approach will vastly minimize response time to new threats.Counter-crime InitiativesLessons from Bitcoin‚Äôs changing usage, can also help counter-crime professionals grasp distinct features of organized crime syndicates. Case in point, crime rings still reliant on Bitcoin would signify a lack of agility in leadership. Additionally, position on an ‚Äòagility spectrum‚Äô can help infer further actionable insights about any syndicate, such its level of resourcefulness and technical expertise. This can also aid law enforcement in sizing the unique effort required in combating each crime ring. Case in point, crime syndicates which pioneered the shift away from Bitcoin, and are (consequently) ahead of the curve, would be operating at a relatively higher level of ingenuity, while continuously adapting to slip through the cracks.Concluding ThoughtsThe switch of financial crime away from Bitcoin, sheds light on the need of a more nuanced approach to curating apt and dynamic regulatory and policy frameworks for digital assets and blockchains. It also highlights the dangers of applying broad strokes to the entire spectrum of cryptofinance, when it comes to policy debates on criminal usage.This is a guest post by Debanjan Chatterjee.

        "title": "GBTC Outflows: Forecasting Total Bitcoin Selling Pressure & Market Impact",
        "summary": "Despite $824 million of net inflows since Spot ETF approval, bitcoin fell 19% in part from $4.39 billion bleeding out of GBTC. This is good for Bitcoin.",
        "content": "The following is a heuristic analysis of GBTC outflows and is not intended to be strictly mathematical, but instead to serve as a tool to help people understand the current state of GBTC selling from a high level, and to estimate the scale of future outflows that may occur.Number Go DownJanuary 25, 2024 ‚Äì Since Wall Street came to Bitcoin under the auspices of Spot ETF approval, the market has been met with relentless selling from the largest pool of bitcoin in the world: the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) which held more than 630,000 bitcoin at its peak. After conversion from a closed-end fund to a Spot ETF, GBTC‚Äôs treasury (3% of all 21 million bitcoin) has bled more than $4 billion during the first 9 days of ETF trading, while other ETF participants have seen inflows of approximately $5.2 billion over that same period. The result ‚Äì $824 million in net inflows ‚Äì is somewhat surprising given the sharply negative price action since the SEC lent its stamp of approval.\n\nSource: James Seffart, @JSefyy\nIn trying to forecast the near-term price impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, we must first understand for how long and to what magnitude GBTC outflows will continue. Below is a review of the causes of GBTC outflows, who the sellers are, their estimated relative stockpiles, and how long we can expect the outflows to take. Ultimately these projected outflows, despite being undoubtedly large, are counterintuitively extremely bullish for bitcoin in the medium-term despite the downside volatility that we have all experienced (and perhaps most did not expect) post ETF-approval.The GBTC Hangover: Paying For It First, some housekeeping on GBTC. It is now plainly clear just how important of a catalyst the GBTC arbitrage trade was in fomenting the 2020-2021 Bitcoin bull run. The GBTC premium was the rocket fuel driving the market higher, allowing market participants (3AC, Babel, Celsius, Blockfi, Voyager etc.) to acquire shares at net asset value, all the while marking their book value up to include the premium. Essentially, the premium drove demand for creation of GBTC shares, which in turn drove bidding for spot bitcoin. It was basically risk free‚Ä¶ While the premium took the market higher during the 2020+ bull run and billions of dollars poured in to capture the GBTC premium, the story quickly turned sour. As the GBTC golden goose ran dry and the Trust began trading below NAV in February 2021, a daisy chain of liquidations ensued. The GBTC discount essentially took the balance sheet of the entire industry down with it.Sparked by the implosion of Terra Luna in May 2022, cascading liquidations of GBTC shares by parties like 3AC and Babel (the so-called ‚Äúcrypto contagion‚Äù) ensued, pushing the GBTC discount down even further. Since then, GBTC has been an albatross around the neck of bitcoin, and continues to be, as the bankruptcy estates of those hung out to dry on the GBTC ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù trade are still liquidating their GBTC shares to this day. Of the aforementioned victims of the ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù trade and its collateral damage, the FTX estate (the largest of those parties) finally liquidated 20,000 BTC across the first 8 days of Spot Bitcoin ETF trading in order to pay back its creditors.It is also important to note the role of the steep GBTC discount relative to NAV and its impact on spot bitcoin demand. The discount incentivized investors to go long GBTC and short BTC, collecting a BTC-denominated return as GBTC crept back up toward NAV. This dynamic further siphoned spot bitcoin demand away ‚Äì a toxic combination that has further plagued the market until the GBTC discount recently returned to near-neutral post ETF approval.\n\nSource: ycharts.com\nWith all that said, there are considerable quantities of bankruptcy estates that still hold GBTC and will continue to liquidate from the stockpile of 600,000 BTC that Grayscale owned (512,000 BTC as of January 26, 2024). The following is an attempt to highlight different segments of GBTC shareholders, and to then interpret what additional outflows we may see in accordance with the financial strategy for each segment.Optimal Strategy For Different Segments Of GBTC OwnersSimply put, the question is: of the ~600,000 Bitcoin that were in the trust, how many of them are likely to exit GBTC in total? Subsequently, of those outflows, how many are going to rotate back into a Bitcoin product, or Bitcoin itself, thus largely negating the selling pressure? This is where it gets tricky, and knowing who owns GBTC shares, and what their incentives are, is important.The two key aspects driving GBTC outflows are as follows: fee structure (1.5% annual fee) and idiosyncratic selling depending on each shareholder's unique financial circumstance (cost basis, tax incentives, bankruptcy etc.).Bankruptcy EstatesEstimated Ownership: 15% (89.5m shares | 77,000 BTC)As of January 22, 2024 the FTX estate has liquidated its entire GBTC holdings of 22m shares (~20,000 BTC). Other bankrupt parties, including GBTC sister company Genesis Global (36m shares / ~32,000 BTC) and an additional (not publicly identified) entity holds approximately 31m shares (~28,000 BTC). To reiterate: bankruptcy estates held approximately 15.5% of GBTC shares (90m shares / ~80,000 BTC), and likely most or all of these shares will be sold as soon as legally possible in order to repay the creditors of these estates. The FTX estate has already sold 22 million shares (~20,000 BTC), while it is not clear if Genesis and the other party have sold their stake. Taking all of this together, it is likely that a significant portion of bankruptcy sales have already been digested by the market aided in no small part by FTX ripping off the bandaid on January 22, 2024.One wrinkle to add to the bankruptcy sales: these will likely not be smooth or drawn out, but more lump-sum as in the case of FTX. Conversely, other types of shareholders will likely exit their positions in a more drawn-out manner rather than liquidating their holdings in one fell swoop. Once legal hangups are taken care of, it is very likely that 100% of bankruptcy estate shares will be sold.Retail Brokerage & Retirement AccountsEstimated Ownership: 50% (286.5m shares | 255,000 BTC)Next up, retail brokerage account shareholders. GBTC, as one of the first passive products available for retail investors when it launched in 2013, has a massive retail contingency. In my estimation, retail investors hold approximately 50% of GBTC shares (286m shares / ~255,000 bitcoin). This is the trickiest tranche of shares to project in terms of their optimal path forward because their decision to sell or not will depend upon the price of bitcoin, which then dictates the tax status for each share purchase.For example, if the price of bitcoin rises, a greater proportion of retail shares will be in-profit, meaning if they rotate out of GBTC, they will incur a taxable event in the form of capital gains, thus they will likely stay put. However, the inverse is true as well. If the price of bitcoin continues to fall, more GBTC investors will not incur a taxable event, and thus will be incentivized to exit. This potential feedback loop marginally increases the pool of sellers that can exit without a tax penalty. Given GBTC‚Äôs unique availability to those early to bitcoin (therefore likely in profit), it is likely that most retail investors will stay put. To put a number on it, it is feasible that 25% retail brokerage accounts will sell, but this is subject to change depending upon bitcoin price action (as noted above).Next up we have retail investors with a tax exempt status who allocated via IRAs (retirement accounts). These shareholders are extremely sensitive to the fee structure and can sell without a taxable event given their IRA status. With GBTC‚Äô egregious 1.5% annual fee (six times that of GBTC‚Äôs competitors), it is all but certain a significant portion of this segment will exit GBTC in favor of other spot ETFs. It is likely that ~75% of these shareholders will exit, while many will remain due to apathy or misunderstanding of GBTC‚Äôs fee structure in relation to other products (or they simply value the liquidity that GBTC offers in relation to other ETF products).On the bright side for spot bitcoin demand from retirement accounts, these GBTC outflows will likely be met with inflows into other Spot ETF products, as they will likely just rotate rather than exiting bitcoin into cash.Institutional ShareholdersEstimated Ownership: 35% (200,000,000 shares | 180,000 BTC)And finally, we have the institutions, which account for approximately 180,000 bitcoin. These players include FirTree and Saba Capital, as well as hedge funds that wanted to arbitrage the GBTC discount and spot bitcoin price discrepancy. This was done by going long GBTC and short bitcoin in order to have net neutral bitcoin positioning and capture GBTC‚Äôs return to NAV.As a caveat, this tranche of shareholders is opaque and hard to forecast, and also acts as a bellwether for bitcoin demand from TradFi. For those with GBTC exposure purely for the aforementioned arbitrage trade, we can assume they will not return to purchase bitcoin through any other mechanism. We estimate investors of this type to make up 25% of all GBTC shares (143m shares / ~130,000 BTC). This is by no means certain, but it would reason that greater than 50% of TradFi will exit to cash without returning to a bitcoin product or physical bitcoin.For Bitcoin-native funds and Bitcoin whales (~5% of total shares), it is likely that their sold GBTC shares will be recycled into bitcoin, resulting in a net-flat impact on bitcoin price. For crypto-native investors (~5% of total shares), they will likely exit GBTC into cash and other crypto assets (not bitcoin). Combined, these two cohorts (57m shares / ~50,000 BTC) will have a net neutral to slightly negative impact on bitcoin price given their relative rotations to cash and bitcoin.Total GBTC Outflows & Net Bitcoin ImpactTo be clear, there is a large amount of uncertainty in these projections, but the following is a ballpark estimate of the overall redemption landscape given the dynamics mentioned between bankruptcy estates, retail brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and institutional investors.Projected Outflows Breakdown:250,000 to 350,000 BTC total projected GBTC outflows100,000 to 150,000 BTC expected to leave the trust and be converted into cash150,000 to 200,000 BTC in GBTC outflows rotating into other trusts or products250,000 to 350,000 bitcoin will remain in GBTC100,000 to 150,000 net-BTC selling pressureTOTAL Expected GBTC-Related Outflows Resulting In Net-BTC Selling Pressure: 100,000 to 150,000 BTCAs of January 26, 2024 approximately 115,000 bitcoin have left GBTC. Given Alameda‚Äôs recorded sale (20,000 bitcoin), we estimate that of the other ~95,000 bitcoin, half have rotated into cash, and half have rotated into bitcoin or other bitcoin products. This implies net-neutral market impact from GBTC outflows.Estimated Outflows Yet To Occur:Bankruptcy Estates: 55,000Retail Brokerage Accounts: 65,000 - 75,000 BTCRetirement Accounts: 10,000 - 12,250 BTCInstitutional Investors: 35,000 - 40,000 BTC TOTAL Estimated Outflows To Come: ~135,000 - 230,000 BTCNote: as said previously, these estimates are the result of a heuristic analysis and should not be interpreted as financial advice and simply aim to inform the reader of what the overall outflow landscape may look like. Additionally, these estimates are pursuant to market conditions.Gradually, Then Suddenly: A Farewell To BearsIn summary, we estimate that the market has already stomached approximately 30-45% of all projected GBTC outflows (115,000 BTC of 250,000-300,000 BTC projected total outflows) and that the remaining 55-70% of expected outflows will follow in short order over the next 20-30 trading days. All in, 150,000 - 200,000 BTC in net selling pressure may result from GBTC sales given that the significant proportion of GBTC outflows will either rotate into other Spot ETF products, or into cold storage bitcoin.We are through the brunt of the pain from Barry Silbert‚Äôs GBTC gauntlet and that is reason to celebrate. The market will be much better off on the other side: GBTC will have finally relinquished its stranglehold over bitcoin markets, and without the specter of the discount or future firesales hanging over the market, bitcoin will be much less encumbered when it does arise. While it will take time to digest the rest of the GBTC outflows, and there will likely be a long tail of people exiting their position (mentioned previously), bitcoin will have plenty of room to run when the Spot ETFs settle into a groove. Oh, and did I mention the halving is coming? But that‚Äôs a story for another time.¬†Bitcoin Magazine is wholly owned by BTC Inc., which operates UTXO Management, a regulated capital allocator focused on the digital assets industry.

        "summary": "Bitcoin Spot ETFs going live is a signal that Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, and politicians are going to have to start developing strategies to confront that reality.",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of financial innovation, the recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs stands as a watershed moment, not just for digital asset enthusiasts, but for the broader financial markets and the political arena. As we edge closer to the 2024 elections, it's becoming increasingly clear that bitcoin is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the political discourse around digital assets, their regulation, and their integration into the mainstream financial ecosystem. The Surge of Mainstream Adoption Bitcoin, once a niche interest of tech enthusiasts and libertarians, has catapulted into the limelight, thanks to the sustained growth in adoption and the recent introduction of Bitcoin ETFs. This groundbreaking development is not merely a triumph for Bitcoin advocates; it signifies a leap towards widespread acceptance and normalization of digital assets. By providing a regulated and familiar investment vehicle for Bitcoin, these ETFs bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets, making Bitcoin accessible to a broader range of investors, including institutions. The involvement of institutional investors in Bitcoin ETFs brings a level of legitimacy and stability that was previously elusive in the cryptocurrency market. Institutions like pension funds, endowments, and large asset managers are known for their rigorous due diligence processes and conservative investment strategies. Their entry reflects a broader acceptance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class, one that merits inclusion among traditionally conservative financial entities. The mainstreaming of Bitcoin is poised to have profound implications for the 2024 elections. For the first time, Bitcoin and digital assets are likely to emerge as a significant policy issue, one that candidates cannot afford to overlook. As more individuals and institutions invest in Bitcoin, public interest in the regulatory and policy framework governing digital assets is surging. This heightened interest will compel political candidates to develop and articulate clear positions on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, framing it as a critical component of their economic and technological platforms. Regulatory clarity and robust policy frameworks for digital assets will become key talking points in election campaigns. Digital Asset Policy And Regulation At The Forefront Of The 2024 Elections The 2024 elections will likely see intense debates over the future direction of the U.S. and global economies, with digital currencies playing a key role. Policies surrounding Bitcoin and digital assets will be indicative of broader economic strategies, touching on issues of financial inclusion, the digitalization of the economy, and the U.S.'s competitive position in the global financial technology race. The integration of Bitcoin into mainstream finance brings with it a host of regulatory challenges and questions. Issues like consumer protection, market stability, anti-money laundering (AML) policies, and cross-border transactions are just the tip of the iceberg. Candidates will need to navigate these complex issues, balancing the need for innovation-friendly policies with the imperative of protecting investors and maintaining financial stability. Furthermore, candidates in the 2024 elections will have to consider the U.S.'s position in the global economy, addressing issues like international cooperation on regulatory standards and the competition to attract and retain digital asset businesses. The most near term issue is that of AML and terrorist financing that was surfaced by the error-filled WSJ article and has been parroted by Senator Warren an untold number of times. Accurate data, and pushing back against the fear mongering of people like Elizabeth Warren is more easily done from the bully pulpit of the Presidency. Shifting Voter Sentiments And Demographics As Bitcoin becomes a mainstream financial instrument, its influence extends beyond investment portfolios to the very heart of voter sentiment. The burgeoning class of digital asset investors, ranging from tech-savvy millennials to institutional stakeholders, represents a significant and influential demographic. Their concerns and interests in digital currency policy are likely to shape the political landscape in 2024, forcing candidates to engage with a broader range of economic issues, including the future of decentralized finance and the role of digital assets in the economy. The evolution of voter demographics and sentiments heralds a new era in political campaigning, where understanding and addressing the nuances of digital finance becomes imperative. Candidates will find themselves navigating a complex landscape where traditional economic policies intersect with emerging digital financial technologies. To resonate with this growing voter base, candidates will need to demonstrate not only an understanding of digital assets and their implications but also present forward-thinking strategies that integrate these technologies into their economic visions. Americans under the age of 30 are seven times more likely to own digital assets than an American over 65. Based on polling in Texas, we see that this trend cuts evenly across party lines. This shift in voter base also raises the bar for political discourse, demanding a more nuanced understanding of technology among political figures. No longer can digital assets be sidelined as a niche interest; they now represent a crucial component of economic discussions that can sway voter opinions. Candidates who adeptly navigate these discussions, offering innovative yet pragmatic solutions, are likely to gain traction among this pivotal demographic. The 2024 elections stand at the crossroads of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset industry, signaling a transition towards a political landscape increasingly shaped by Bitcoin, digital asset, and financial innovation. The Role Of Educational Outreach And Advocacy As the implications of Bitcoin ETFs permeate the mainstream, there's an increasing need for educational outreach and advocacy. Both the public and policymakers must be informed about the nuances of Bitcoin, digital currencies and blockchain technology. This education will play a crucial role in shaping informed public opinion and, consequently, the electoral choices of voters. Organizations and advocates within the digital asset space will have an important role to play in this education and advocacy effort, helping to demystify digital assets for the wider public and policymakers alike. In this dynamic environment, the leadership shown by key regional councils in advancing blockchain understanding and advocating for sound policies sets a benchmark in driving the conversation forward, showcasing the potential of focused expertise and strategic foresight in shaping the future of Bitcoin and digital assets. Conclusion: A New Era Of Politics The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a milestone for the digital asset market; it's a harbinger of a new era in political discourse. The mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other digital currencies will force a reevaluation of economic policies, regulatory frameworks, and even the very nature of financial systems. Candidates in the 2024 elections will need to navigate this new landscape, addressing the complexities of digital assets while resonating with a voter base that is increasingly informed and influenced by the world of cryptocurrency. As we approach the 2024 elections, the intersection of Bitcoin, digital assets, blockchain, and politics is not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in the fabric of economic and political life.This is a guest post by Mark Shut.

Cats are the most viral meme on the internet, so it's not shocking in the least bit that the Taproot Wizards have leaned into it, reinforced by the trolling Luke over his ‚Äúdietary choices.‚Äù The question has to be asked though, are meme campaigns really how we want to go about deciding and discussing consensus changes to a protocol as valuable as Bitcoin? I‚Äôve seen numerous music videos, campaigns to go out in the world and ‚Äúeducate‚Äù people on OP_CAT, and the whole ‚ÄúQuest‚Äù system that Taproot Wizards has launched taking place‚Ä¶but the reality is the vast majority of this content that I have seen has been incredibly superficial. Rijndael, ‚ÄúArtificer‚Äù at Taproot Wizards and one of the few people, if not the only person, actually tinkering and playing with OP_CAT to build out use case examples, has made a demo of a OP_CAT based covenant script. This script enforces a specific amount of Bitcoin be sent to a specific address, and by consensus there is no other way to spend these coins except with a transaction that meets those exact conditions. Look at the size of this script:OP_TOALTSTACK OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT de890a8209d796493ee7bac9a58b62fbced10ccb7311e24f26c461c079ead08c OP_SWAP OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT 54617053696768617368 OP_SHA256 OP_DUP OP_ROT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_SHA256 424950303334302f6368616c6c656e6765 OP_SHA256 OP_DUP OP_ROT 79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798 OP_DUP OP_DUP OP_TOALTSTACK 2 OP_ROLL OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_CAT OP_SHA256 OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_SWAP OP_CAT OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_DUP 1 OP_CAT OP_ROT OP_EQUALVERIFY 2 OP_CAT 79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798 OP_CHECKSIGThis is what it takes to emulate CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. The equivalent script using CTV would simply be:CTV <32 byte hash>. I ask, what is the value of something like OP_CAT in emulating the case of basic template covenants (things requiring a spending transaction to fulfill certain conditions defined ahead of time to be valid) like this? We know exactly how to handle schemes enforcing a template on transactions spending an output locked to a template covenant, and have multiple proposals for them. CTV, TXHASH, OP_TX, and even APO can emulate these schemes by stuffing a signature in the locking output of a transaction at the cost of an extra 64 bytes. What actual use is OP_CAT in ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù to meet the needs of a class of use cases that are mature enough in design that there are at least 4 covenant proposals that can handle those use cases with a tiny fraction of the data cost? ‚ÄúOh, we want to experiment with CAT because it‚Äôs flexible!‚Äù You want to use 30 OP calls to do something that can be done in one? That is a reason to actually enact a consensus change to Bitcoin? The logic of that is beyond absurd. Downplaying RisksIn a vacuum OP_CAT is sold as ‚Äúsimply concatenating two strings‚Äù, and many of the memes attempt framing it as ‚Äúhow can that be dangerous?‚Äù This is a wildly disingenuous narrative surrounding the proposal, and it completely ignores how it interacts with other existing and future aspects of script. In particular CSFS + CAT opens a massive amount of possibilities in terms of what can be done with Bitcoin script, not all of it necessarily positive. CSFS allows you to verify a signature on an arbitrary piece of data in the course of executing a script, and CAT allows you to ‚Äúglue‚Äù different pieces of data together on the stack. These two things create a massive design space for what it is possible to do with Bitcoin. One concrete example would be the potential to enforce amounts, or relationships between different amounts, of specific inputs and outputs in a transaction. CAT allows you to build up a transaction hash from individual pieces on the stack, and CSFS allows you to verify a signature against a public key in the locking script against arbitrary pieces of that transaction as it is built up. This could ultimately enable the creation of open-ended UTXOs anyone can spend, as long as the spending transaction meets certain criteria, such as a specific amount of coins be sent to a specific address. Combine this with the reality of OP_RETURN based assets, and this starts getting into the territory of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX). Some of the worst incentive distortion problems that have come to fruition on other blockchains ultimately stem from the creation of DEXes on those chains. Having direct non-interactive exchange functionality on the blockchain is one of the worst forms of MEV, especially when the potential exists for miners to lock-in their profit across multiple trades in the span of a single block, rather than having to actually carry the risk of a position across multiple blocks before closing it out and realizing profit. Part of the movement behind Taproot Wizards is ‚Äúbringing the innovation back.‚Äù I.e. that lessons learned in shitcoin land are coming home to Bitcoin, now while I firmly reject the notion that anything useful has been developed on other coins in the last decade other than the basic concept of zero knowledge proofs, this mantra getting louder ignores a massive component of that dynamic even if you disagree with my view there: there are lessons to be learned regarding what NOT to do as well as what TO do. DEXes are one of the things NOT to do. Nothing has caused as much chaos, volatility in fee dynamics (which we need to smooth out over time for sustainability of second layers), and just all around incentive chaos regarding the base consensus layers of these protocols and their degree of centralization. The idea that we should rush to bring these types of problems to Bitcoin, or exacerbate them by introducing a way to trustlessly embed the bitcoin asset into them in more dynamic and flexible ways, is frankly insane. This to me speaks of large swaths of people who haven‚Äôt learned anything from watching what happened on other blockchains in the last half decade or so. Forever Shackled By The CatLooking at the dynamic above between CSFS + CAT, it is worth pointing out that Reardencode‚Äôs recent LNHANCE proposal (CTV + CSFS + Internal Key) offers a path to give us eltoo for Lightning in a way that is actually more blockspace efficient than using APO. If this argumentation, and build out of proof of concepts, winds up winning over Lightning developers who want LN symmetry in order to simplify Lightning channel management and implementation maintenance, we very well could wind up getting CSFS in the process. If OP_CAT were active prior to this, then there is no way to avoid the types of detrimental side effects of the two proposals being combined. This would hold true for every soft fork proposal going forward if OP_CAT were ever activated. It would be impossible to escape whatever side effects or use cases were enabled by combining OP_CAT with whatever new proposals come in future. On its own OP_CAT is clunky, inefficient, and rather pointless. But in combination with other OPs it begins to get stupidly flexible and powerful. This would be a dynamic we would never be able to escape, and features that might wind up being critically necessary in the future for Bitcoin‚Äôs scalability could inescapably come with massive downsides and risks simply because of the existence of OP_CAT. Is this a reality we want to enter simply because of a meme campaign? Because people want to tinker with wildly inefficient means of doing things instead of looking through much more efficient and purpose built proposals? I would say no. Meme campaigns can be fun, I know this. They foster a sense of community and involvement, it's an inherent and inescapable part of the internet and the numerous cultures that exist on it. But this is not how we should be deciding the development process of Bitcoin. They can be fun, and they can even be viciously savage at stabbing directly to the heart of matters people dance around or equivocate on. But they are atrocious at capturing nuance and complexity in many regards. Trying to steer the consensus of a network like Bitcoin purely based on the value of a meme, rather than reasoned consideration of proposals and their implications, is a disaster waiting to happen. The conservatism and caution of Bitcoin development is what has kept it at the forefront of this space as shitcoins have come and gone, imploding in the consequences of their fly by night carefree development attitude. As much as Bitcoin sorely needs to break out of its current rut of stagnation and lack of forward progress, devolving to uncritical memes and music videos is not how to do that. It risks destroying what made Bitcoin valuable in the first place, its solid and conservative foundation.¬†",

        "title": "A Bitcoin Standard Unleashed",
        "summary": "What realistic implications exist for different facets of global society if Bitcoin were to take over as the gravitational center of the world economy?",
        "content": "IntroductionThe transition from Fiat Standards to the Bitcoin Standard, though highly desirable, is not inevitable or necessarily imminent. The timing and occurrence of these changes hinge on the adoption choices made by individuals, organizations, and public entities. These decisions are influenced not only by rational considerations but also by emotional and irrational factors (greed and fear above all). The collective will, formed by the intentions of a critical mass with sufficient capital and agency, plays a crucial role in displacing central banks and the entrenched power structures in favor of a new system centered around Bitcoin. Despite Bitcoin's evident technical, economic, and ethical superiority over other form of money, this struggle will undoubtedly be a formidable one, with the outcome far from assured.Nonetheless, it is crucial to reflect on the consequences that this potential revolution, if realized (as we all hope), could have on every facet of social existence. These implications span from the nature of states and international relations to the functioning of economic systems, prevailing value systems, and even the energy market and technological innovation. In this article, without the pretense of being exhaustive, we aim to briefly explore some of these aspects and suggest plausible trajectories.Bitcoin and Fractional Reserve BankingAs Hal Finney correctly forecasted, a hypothetical Bitcoin Standard would be incompatible with central banks but not necessarily with a fractional reserve banking system. Algorithmic limits on the number of transactions per block will certainly prevent Layer 1 from serving as a retail payment system. Over time, fewer transactions will occur on it, and these will be of a very high value (in practice, only whales or large public and private institutions, given the high costs, will be able to afford them).Some form of free banking 2.0 on Layer 2 would then be quite inevitable in the medium to long term for a Bitcoin-based monetary system. In the absence of a central bank as the lender of last resort and with much easier reserve verifiability than with gold, this Layer 2/layer 3 FRB (Fractional Reserve Banking) will be much more fragile than the current fractional reserve system supported by legal tender, central bank, and practical indistinguishability between the monetary base and the money supply. This will only reinforce the importance of Layer 1 as the solid foundation of the monetary system, similar to the role gold played in past millennia.Macroeconomic ImplicationsCeteris Paribus, in the medium term, the adoption of a hypothetical Bitcoin Standard should significantly dampen economic cycle fluctuations, preventing excessive indebtedness, mal-investment, and credit bubbles in the private sector, leading to systemic debt crises. Monetary repression would also result in much slower but steady real growth rates in economies in the medium to long term. With the absence of the engine of monetary and credit expansion, i.e., the inflationary policies of central banks, the nominal growth of output within a Bitcoin Standard will be modest, but real growth will remain significant. In other words, any increase in multi-factor productivity will result in a decline in consumer prices measured in satoshis rather than an increase in nominal output. In this context, even in the short term, economic growth will depend on demographic, ecological, and economic factors rather than monetary or credit factors.In this regard, with the Bitcoin Standard, there will be a gradual shift of wealth from the financial sector, which has become voracious today, to the real and productive economy. This is a consequence of the significant downsizing of bond and money markets (reduction in the level of indebtedness of economies) and therefore the entire industry profiting from them.Among the businesses that will experience the most downsizing are centralized payment and clearing systems, traditional credit institutions, fiduciary agents such as notaries (replaced by smart contracts on Layer 2 and 3 of Bitcoin), and those involved in financial, real estate, and insurance intermediation.On the contrary, anything leveraging the potential of Bitcoin's layers (for smart contracts) and DeFi will experience a real boom.(Geo)political ImplicationsRegarding the immutability of the monetary base, it would force states into strict fiscal discipline as the option to monetize deficits or debt as a form of public spending financing would disappear. This will profoundly influence the ability of nation-states to provide welfare or wage wars. In the absence of a monetary printing press and, thus, the insidious tax called inflation, fiscal pressure and the allocation of public spending will become the subject of serious negotiations and political disputes, as they will directly affect the pockets of citizens/subjects/taxpayers. On one hand, this could encourage more direct forms of democracy (facilitated by the spread of blockchains and DAOs) to give citizens a greater say in tax and spending decisions. On the other hand, a world based on the Bitcoin Standard could lead to a much more fragmented and apolar geopolitical landscape, given the intrinsic unsustainability of maintaining such large and inefficient state apparatuses, resembling more the classic medieval feudalism. Instead of the sword/blood/robe aristocracy, Bitcoin whales would become the dominant social class, where non-coiners would be a kind of new serfdom. The former, individuals, families, and institutions with huge Bitcoin holdings (created in the early stages of adopting this technology, i.e., in the first two decades of its existence), would be able to provide welfare, work, and protection to citizens/subjects in exchange for loyalty, services, and obedience to their \"feudal\" rule. The latter, the vast majority of the population whose ancestors arrived too late to adopt and convert their fiat capital into Bitcoin (for various ideological or practical reasons, including economic constraints), would find themselves at the bottom of the pyramid and would be forced to earn their living through the sweat of their brow or (more likely, given technological advances) through the generosity, more or less interested, of philanthropic whales. This dynamic would also apply internationally: there would be pioneering regions or nations that, having adopted Bitcoin as legal tender first, would enjoy a significant relative wealth advantage that would be hard to match by latecomers. These would not necessarily be the currently dominant nations; in fact, some may not even exist at present. The ultimate result would be a much more fragmented international system than the current one, consisting of a mix of democratic, socialist, or oligarchic city-states, crypto-aristocratic fiefdoms centered around individual families, and large anarchic and chaotic regions. All these entities would be in competition/cooperation with each other, forming a completely new and constantly evolving geopolitical-ideological landscape. In a world where old identity affiliations (national, ideological, and religious) would overlap and mix with new identities based on the interpretation of the Bitcoin revolution. Given the technological assumptions and ideological foundations of Bitcoin culture, a \"coinist\" religion could emerge, tied to certain ritualistic and faith-based aspects that are already glimpsed among its staunch supporters (immaculate conception, decentralization, worship of Satoshi, algorithmic infallibility). In any case, the Bitcoin Standard would impose on the societies adopting it some economic norms closely influencing public morality. Among them are the sense of limit, the ethic of saving, prudence in investments, long-termism, honesty in commercial transactions, individual responsibility, fiscal discipline, and, of course, the independence and incorruptibility of money from state powers.Nodes, Mining, and GeopoliticsNodes are the heart of the Bitcoin network and would, therefore, receive significant attention from political powers. Controlling full nodes (and thus potential miners) within a specific territory by public authorities would be extremely important for claiming sovereignty internally and influencing the international scene. Naturally, given other variables, nations capable of producing energy at lower costs or on a larger scale would have an advantage in allocating and thus controlling significant shares of the global bitcoin hashrate. An eternal struggle for control of the global hashrate will be the new center of geo-economic disputes. That being said, it is by no means guaranteed that most territorial political entities will be able to effectively exert this control, and it's uncertain how they will go about doing so. While legitimate physical coercion might seem like the obvious choice, given the specific nature of states, it may not necessarily be the most successful approach in a geopolitically more fragmented and competitive landscape than the current one. Thanks to the high mobility of Bitcoin and the fiscal constraints imposed on traditional states by this monetary system, miners and whales alike could quite easily opt to move elsewhere if their property rights and entrepreneurial freedom end up in danger, finding sanctuary in more libertarian jurisdictions. On the flip side, a different scenario may unfold for those novel 'neo-aristocratic' state entities built around one or more Whales; in this case, the monopoly over mining and the necessary energy resources might be more pronounced, given the immense economic power held by their governing bodies.Energy Market ImplicationsBitcoin is not a commodity currency but an energy one. The power it encapsulates is the energy consumed to create and transfer it. As the lifeblood of the new monetary paradigm, therefore, energy will be even more at the core of the economic system than today. This will radically inform progress in the energy sector, generating a race for technological innovations on both the extraction and energy-saving sides. A whole range of energy sources previously neglected as uneconomical could now become convenient and accessible thanks to their use for mining. Think of the sun in African and Asian deserts, deposits of methane and natural gas in remote locations, or geothermal energy from volcanoes and geysers, or even some systems based on wave motion and temperature differentials in the depths of the oceans.With an ever-increasing demand for energy, there will be a growing incentive to generate more energy and do so more efficiently in a virtuous circle that could lead to a major energetical revolution, potentially bringing humankind closer to a level 2 civilization on the Kardashev scale, certainly contributing to electrifying the planet even in the remotest places. Another likely consequence of a Bitcoin Standard will be the reversal of roles between energy producers and consumers. The largest energy consumers (mining farms) will over time become the main energy producers in a vertical integration of assets and energy infrastructure that, starting from the bottom, will assimilate the entire energy industry. Whether this will lead to greater or lesser concentration versus decentralization of energy producers remains to be seen, but it will certainly depend on the commercial dynamics of the mining industry.This is a guest post by Michele Uberti.

Box 39Vienna, VA 22183SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLYRe: Docket Number FINCEN‚Äì2023‚Äì0016 ‚Äì Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering ConcernDear Director Gacki:We appreciate the opportunity to comment on Docket Number FINCEN-2023-0016 (the \"Mixing Transaction NPRM\"), released by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\"FinCEN\") on October 22, 2023.[1] We are a variety of unaffiliated companies that rely on important cybersecurity safeguards and privacy-enabling software to protect our businesses and our users. The extreme breadth of the rules proposed by the Mixing Transaction NPRM would overly burden our use of such technologies in ways that would not assist FinCEN in achieving its mandate of preventing money laundering and other illicit use of money. As a result, we write to express our grave concerns regarding the novelty and scope of the Proposed Special Measures and the inadequate definitions contained therein.[2]The Proposed Special Measures would unreasonably infringe upon the legitimate financial privacy interests of cryptocurrency users, and would apply to a variety of digital techniques that are not mixing transactions at all, but rather simply represent good cybersecurity practices. Moreover, the Proposed Special Measures are unnecessary to achieve FinCEN's aim, and we encourage FinCEN to either withdraw the Mixing Transaction NPRM altogether or to pursue a less invasive, less restrictive, and more effective approach‚Äîthe same approach it has used since its first enforcement activities in the cryptocurrency space in 2013‚Äîto enforcement against specific bad actors.1. FinCEN should exercise caution and either withdraw entirely or narrowly tailor the Mixing Transaction NPRM because if adopted, the Mixing Transaction NPRM would not only represent the first time FinCEN used its Section 311 powers against a class of transactions, but also the first time FinCEN has ever imposed Special Measure 1.Historically, FinCEN has exercised caution in making designations under Section 311 and implementing Special Measures. Section 311 (31 U.S.C. 5318A), authorizes the U.S. Department of Treasury (\"Treasury\") to designate a foreign jurisdiction, financial institution, class of transactions, or type of account as being of \"primary money laundering concern\" and impose one or more of five possible \"special measures.\" Treasury delegated that authority to FinCEN, which has used its power quite sparingly since Section 311's enactment. The first Section 311 action instituted by FinCEN in the virtual currency space occurred in 2013, when FinCEN instituted special measures against Liberty Reserve. Prior to that time, between 2002 and 2013, FinCEN had only ever implemented special measures against just four jurisdictions and 13 financial institutions. After a protracted legal battle regarding a Section 311 action between 2015-2017, FinCEN seemed reluctant to use its Section 311 powers widely. [3] The creation of the Global Investigations Division (GID) in 2019 [4] and the enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which increased FinCEN's authority \"to prohibit or impose conditions upon certain transmittals of funds (to be defined by the Secretary) by any domestic financial institution or domestic financial agency,\" [5] coincided with an uptick in the use of Section 311 powers and a broadening of FinCEN's attention to all 5 available Special Measures.Importantly, throughout its use of Section 311, FinCEN traditionally imposes Special Measure Number 5 to isolate a specific foreign financial institution and prevent it from accessing the U.S. financial system. Until this Mixing Transaction NPRM, FinCEN has only used Special Measure Number 1 one other time‚Äîin 2012 against JSC CredexBank (\"Credex\").[6] FinCEN later withdrew that proposed rule in 2016. [7] If adopted, the Mixing Transaction NPRM would constitute the first time FinCEN has imposed Special Measure Number 1 in exercising its Section 311 Powers. Moreover, this Mixing Transaction NPRM represents the very first time FinCEN has sought to designate an entire class of transactions as a primary money laundering concern. We encourage FinCEN to exercise extreme caution in the exercise of its Section 311 powers in such a novel way‚Äîthe first-ever designation of a class of transactions and the first-ever imposition of Special Measure 1.Exercising caution in Section 311 powers reflects the seriousness of Treasury's policy purposes for invoking its powers to make primary money laundering concern designations and impose special measures‚Äînamely, to act as a signal to the world that FinCEN is \"serious about ensuring that the international financial system is safeguarded against the threat of money laundering.\" [8] As Treasury explained in the press release announcing the very first use of its Section 311 powers in 2002, when FinCEN uses Section 311, \"[FinCEN] tell[s] the world clearly that these jurisdictions [or entities or transactions] are bad for business and that their financial controls cannot be trusted.\" [9] For the reasons further explained below, FinCEN's targeting of convertible virtual currency (\"CVC\") [10] purported \"mixing\" transactions does not achieve these aims. Rather than target transactions that are \"bad for business,\" the Mixing Transaction NPRM targets an overly broad range of technical approaches used as best practices both by businesses and individuals for ensuring the security of CVC and impinges on privacy rights of legitimate users of CVC. In an attempt to exercise authority it has never used before (class of transactions) through a special measure it has never previously imposed successfully (special measure 1), FinCEN created a proposed rule fraught with misunderstandings and overreach. We urge FinCEN to withdraw the rule and reconsider its approach to this novel use of its authority.2. The Mixing Transaction NPRM proposes a rule that is an improper and overbroad application of Section 311 measures to achieve transaction surveillance and suppression that FinCEN does not otherwise have a lawful basis to undertake.Although the Mixing Transaction NPRM ostensibly designates a class of transactions as being of Primary Money Laundering Concern, its real goal is to uncover an alternative method for collecting information about and suppressing the use of digital currency in general. The Mixing Transaction NPRM is an improper and overbroad application of Section 311 measures for that purpose. Indeed, although the Mixing Transaction NPRM allegedly sanctions a class of transactions, it inconsistently throughout refers to \"CVC mixers,\" \"CVC mixing\" and \"CVC mixing services\" by reference to specific business entities [11] and as a type of business model more generally.[12] If FinCEN has reason to believe specific entities conduct illicit activities, FinCEN could use the Section 311 powers it has traditionally and successfully used to target specific entities as financial institutions of primary money laundering concern. Such an approach offers a more targeted way to address actual money laundering while protecting legitimate users of legitimate privacy-enhancing tools.Notably, Treasury has separately sanctioned what it refers to as CVC mixing transactions through its Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) authority to designate people or property who conduct transactions with specifically designated foreign jurisdictions identified through executive order as posing terrorist threats. [13] Treasury is currently facing legal challenges to, and has been widely criticized for, its attempt to sanction the Tornado Cash open source software as property of a non-existent entity Treasury alleges is called \"the Tornado Cash DAO entity.\" [14] Although we agree with the many arguments as to why Treasury's OFAC action with regard to Tornado Cash software is an example of agency overreach, we wish to make a different but related point here. To justify its OFAC sanctions against the Tornado Cash software, Treasury had to designate the software as property of an entity. [15] OFAC officially explained as part of defending its sanction to a judge that the Tornado Cash software was property under Treasury's regulations because it fell within the broad reach of \"any contract whatsoever.\" [16] Although the definition of \"transaction\" under the BSA regulations is quite broad, it does not encompass \"any contract whatsoever\" but rather centers on monetary transfers and specific services offered by financial institutions, and provides a catch-all for \"any other payment, transfer, or delivery by, through or to a financial institution, by whatever means effected.\" [17] No part of the definition applicable to CVC mixing is also a contract.[18]In other words, in proposing the Mixing Transaction NPRM, one arm of Treasury is classifying CVC mixing as a transaction type while another arm of Treasury argues that mixing is a contract for services. Under the regulations governing both enforcement actions, mixing activity cannot be both a transaction type and a contract for service simultaneously. Treasury's attempt to designate mixing software as both a type of transaction and a contract is evidence of the arbitrary and capricious nature of its attempt to regulate open-source software that enhances the digital privacy of legitimate CVC users. To the extent that FinCEN really wants to target non-custodial, open-source software that individuals can use on their own accounts, FinCEN exceeds its statutory authority.Indeed, tools that enhance digital privacy in CVC transactions simply seek to enable a form of digital cash. As a result, in its rush to find a way to suppress CVC mixing transactions, by whichever means, even if inconsistent amongst different internal branches of its own agency, FinCEN's Mixing Transaction NPRM amounts to an attempt to sanction \"all transactions conducted in cash,\" which is both impossible and an unreasonable over-extension of its rulemaking authority.3. The Mixing Transaction NPRM should be withdrawn because the proposed definition of \"CVC mixing\" is overbroad and targets lawful activity in a way that makes the agency's proposed action arbitrary and capricious.Setting aside FinCEN's own apparent confusion about whether CVC mixing is a transaction, a service, a business, or a specific business entity, when FinCEN does attempt to define the \"class\" of transactions that it considers to be CVC mixing, the Mixing Transaction NPRM's definition of \"mixing\" is extremely broad and includes numerous activities routinely conducted by legitimate users as a matter of routine safety precautions in online transacting in CVC. Specifically, the Mixing Transaction NPRM provides:The term \"CVC mixing\" means the facilitation of CVC transactions in a manner that obfuscates the source, destination, or amount involved in one or more transactions, regardless of the type of protocol or service used, such as: (1) pooling or aggregating CVC from multiple persons, wallets, addresses or accounts; (2) using programmatic or algorithmic code to coordinate, manage, or manipulate the structure of a transaction; (3) splitting CVC for transmittal and transmitting the CVC through a series of independent transactions; (4) creating and using single-use wallets, addresses, or accounts, and sending CVC through such wallets, addresses, or accounts through a series of independent transactions; (5) exchanging between types of CVC or other digital assets; [19] or (6) facilitating user-initiated delays in transactional activity. [20]Indeed, most of the activities captured by the proposed definition of CVC mixing are considered established best practices within the industry for the use and safekeeping of CVC. Specifically, the proposed definition encompasses lightning transactions, single-use wallets, atomic swaps, decentralized finance protocols, privacy coin features, and multi-signature wallets, among other things. The main commonality among this broad range of software tools is that they enhance digital privacy and offer basic cyber-security techniques to owners or custodians of CVC. Employing these techniques to safeguard valuable digital assets is as routine and mundane and free of illicit purpose as using two-factor authentication to secure a digital wallet containing payment card information or an X (formerly Twitter) account to prevent an unauthorized announcement.[21]4. The Mixing Transaction NPRM should be withdrawn because its inaccurate depiction of standard security practices as \"mixing\" impermissibly restricts the capacity of users to protect their property so that FinCEN can conduct a fishing expedition.The proposed rule describes as red flags such everyday practices as \"creating and using single address wallets\" and \"splitting CVC for transmittal.\" [22] The standard practice among cryptocurrency users is to change addresses with every transaction. For example, Coinbase Exchange describes to their users that: \"[w]e automatically generate a new address for you after every transaction you make or when funds are moved between your wallet and our storage system. This is done to protect your privacy, so a third party cannot view all other transactions associated with your account simply by using a blockchain explorer.\" [23]The fact that a small subset of users, who may be criminals, engage in the same operational security practices as ordinary users does not make those operational security practices suspect. The fact that criminals may use two-factor authentication to protect the security of their online applications does not mean that the use of two-factor authentication is itself an indicator or facilitator of criminal activity. In exactly the same way, the fact that users do not reuse Bitcoin addresses is merely indicative of basic operational security.In an apparent recognition of the fact that these tools legitimately enable important cyber-security precautions, FinCEN exempts financial institutions from reporting on any of their own mixing transactions that they may conduct in the course of providing services to the public.[24] By exempting financial institutions from the rule, FinCEN creates a regime where financial institutions can take proper cyber-security measures for using CVC, but regular people cannot.Perhaps even more problematic, throughout the Mixing Transaction NPRM, FinCEN justifies the proposed rule as necessary to enable law enforcement and the agency to better understand the transactions and the extent to which illicit activity occurs through CVC mixing. [25] The extraordinary and never before successfully invoked Section 311 power to designate a class of transactions and implement special measure 1 is not appropriate for use in a fact-finding mission. Employing such overly broad definitions as proposed in the Mixing Transaction NPRM for the purpose of authorizing an invasive fact-finding mission represents an arbitrary and capricious use of FinCEN's delegated rulemaking authority because FinCEN's justification for the rule lies outside of the statutory criteria for determining a class of transactions is of primary money laundering concern.Specifically, FinCEN is statutorily required to consider the following factors when determining that a class of transactions is of primary money laundering concern: (1) the extent to which the class of transactions is used to facilitate or promote money laundering in or through a jurisdiction outside of the United States, including money laundering activity with connections to international terrorism, organized crime, and proliferation of WMDs and missiles; (2) the extent to which a class of transactions is used for legitimate business purposes; and (3) the extent to which action by FinCEN would guard against international money laundering and other financial crimes.\" [26] Throughout the Mixing Transaction NPRM, FinCEN acknowledges that due to a lack of data and a lack of understanding of CVC mixers, it cannot sufficiently assess the extent to which CVC mixing and the proposed rule measures up under any of these three criteria. [27] FinCEN's assessment ultimately boils down to: FinCEN does not have sufficient information to properly assess the statutory criteria required to justify the proposed rule, so the proposed rule is justified because, in FinCEN's own words, it \"is necessary to better understand the illicit finance risk posed by CVC mixing.\" [28] Using a sanction to obtain the information necessary to justify imposing the sanction even when the agency knows that doing so will likely impose a high burden on legitimate uses and financial institutions is the definition of arbitrary and capricious regulatory action.5. The Mixing Transaction NPRM should be withdrawn or significantly narrowed in scope because FinCEN's required statutory analysis fails to adequately value the legitimate uses of CVC mixing services and unduly burdens legitimate users and financial institutions.FinCEN admits that public blockchains \"make it possible to know someone's entire financial history on the blockchain\" [29] and that it \"recognizes that there are legitimate reasons why responsible actors might want to conduct financial transactions in a secure and private manner given the amount of information available on public blockchains.\" [30] Yet, in the same document, alleges that the Mixing Transaction NPRM is necessary because CVC \"is not without its risks and, in particular, the use of CVC to anonymize illicit activity undermines the legitimate and innovative uses of CVC.\" [31] These two propositions cannot be simultaneously accurate.As a matter of technical reality, FinCEN's assertion that public blockchains expose a user's entire financial history on the blockchain to the public for everyone to see and inspect is correct. [32] Indeed, that creates the fundamental need for legitimate CVC users to conduct CVC mixing transactions‚Äîto reintroduce the same level of financial privacy that they enjoy in the traditional financial system [33] to their transactions via CVC (for example, the traditional financial system does not expose a consumer's entire credit card history to the public, and indeed, federal law requires that financial institutions protect such information from being exposed to the public [34]). [35]Ensuring their CVC transactions enjoy the same level of privacy as transactions in traditional finance reduces the potential danger of personal harm to legitimate users and enables legitimate users to avoid waiving their constitutional right to privacy. When the identity of a legitimate CVC user is known and connected to the wallets holding CVC assets, the user becomes a target for kidnap, robbery, extortion, and hacking schemes. [36] Further, because of this inherent transparency by design of public blockchains, the Fifth Circuit recently ruled that no expectation of privacy exists for users of permissionless public blockchains who take no additional action to privacy-protect their transactions. [37] Legitimate users employ privacy-enhancing software when transacting in CVC in order to avoid inadvertently waiving their constitutionally protected privacy rights.Ultimately, FinCEN has completely failed in its obligation to adequately account for the impact on legitimate users as required by its rulemaking authority. In defending its selection of special measure 1 over 2 through 5, FinCEN emphasizes, without explanation, that special measure 1‚Äîadditional record keeping‚Äîallows legitimate users to continue using privacy-enhancing software without interruption. [38] This is false, as covered entities must report on any transaction that may have involved CVC mixing and a foreign jurisdiction. Indeed, read broadly, it is possible that the rules proposed by the Mixing Transaction NPRM require reporting on transactions that involve CVC that were transacted through mixing software at any point in the asset's transaction history. Such reporting directly impedes the reasons for which legitimate users employ mixing software (to enhance financial privacy) by requiring the elimination of financial privacy (it is not a private transaction if an intermediary must surveil and report on the transaction). Software tools like mixers that enhance digital financial privacy provide a true electronic equivalent to cash. Notably, transactions in cash are not subject to rules such as those proposed in the Mixing Transaction NPRM. In an apparent acknowledgment of this deep and inherent conflict between the rules proposed by the Mixing Transaction NPRM and the legitimate uses to which legitimate users put CVC mixing software, FinCEN itself predicts that the rule will chill the use of CVC mixers.6. The Mixing Transaction NPRM should be withdrawn because it requires covered financial institutions to perform law enforcement's function to accomplish FinCEN's AML goals, which FinCEN, DOJ, and law enforcement can achieve using existing tools when they have a proper legal basis to employ those tools.Like the definitions of CVC mixing and CVC mixer, the Mixing Transaction NPRM's information reporting requirements demonstrate a deep lack of technological understanding. Notably, all of the transaction information that the Mixing Transaction NPRM proposes to include in required reports by covered financial institutions involves data that, in most circumstances, FinCEN can just as easily obtain itself through blockchain data analytics. Similarly, the customer information that FinCEN would require covered financial institutions to report includes the same kinds of information such institutions must already report if a transaction raises sufficient red flags to trigger the filing of a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). Nevertheless, the Mixing Transaction NPRM seeks to require covered financial institutions to file such reports on every single transaction for which the CVC involved may have ever been transacted through the extremely broad set of software that FinCEN's proposed rule defines as CVC mixing software. In other words, because law enforcement investigations into activity involving CVC are sometimes more difficult, FinCEN seeks to impose broad surveillance of individuals without cause through covered financial institutions. Covered financial institutions should not have to become de facto law enforcement officers to make investigations easier for FinCEN.FinCEN, the Department of Justice, and law enforcement have previously and successfully employed the very tools FinCEN asks financial institutions to use for reporting compliance under the Mixing Transaction NPRM to target specific illicit actors. FinCEN has demonstrated that it knows how to properly investigate and enforce against specific custodial CVC mixing service providers that are not complying with the regulations to which they are subject. Specifically targeting illicit actors about which FinCEN and law enforcement have built a clear, strong case using the available blockchain data analytics tools better balances the need to combat illicit CVC mixing with the legitimate use of CVC mixing by individuals seeking to protect their legitimate, constitutionally and statutorily protected privacy interests.For all of the reasons discussed above, we urge FinCEN to withdraw the Mixing Transaction NPRM altogether.Thank you for your consideration.If you have any questions or would like additional information, please see the contact information below:Rafael Yakobi, Esq.Managing PartnerThe Crypto Lawyers, PLLC.rafael@thecryptolawyers.com(619) 317-0722Sincerely,\n\nSamourai Wallet, Ten31, River, Strike, RoninDojo, Swan Bitcoin, Primal, GRIID, Zaprite, Peach, Mempool Space, Upstream Data, Stakwork, Vida Global, Voltage, Coinkite, Mutiny Wallet, Standard Bitcoin Company, Satoshi Energy, Cathedra Bitcoin, AnchorWatch, Bitnob, Oshi, Battery Finance,Fold, Start9FinCEN, Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactionsof Primary Money Laundering Concern, Dkt.

        "summary": "Data from traditional markets is slow and incomplete but show $200M per day of inflows to the Bitcoin ETFs. Demand is converging, price will respond.",
        "content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nThe First 5 DaysThe Bitcoin spot ETF launch was one for the history books. By all accounts, it was the largest launch of an ETF product in history, beating out the previous record set by the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) launch in October 2021. First-day trading volume was huge at $4.6 billion, and it has remained relatively strong compared to typical post-launch declines of other products. We can be confident in the volume numbers, unlike the inflows. After the first two days of trading, the market was left wondering about flows because the data provided by TradFi was delayed and incomplete. Experts, such as Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg, said it was normal to have delays in reporting of flows by as much as T+3 (three days after). Bitcoin isn‚Äôt used to such bad transparency.In the below table, you can see the GBTC outflows are now over $2 billion, with the largest day being Day 3. However, it is highly probable that most of Day 3‚Äôs flows was due to trading on Day 2, and likewise for Day 2 on Day 1, and so forth. We also cannot tell if all the issuers are up-to-date on their data. Is that all their flows or are they not done counting? We simply don‚Äôt know.\n\nBitcoiners are supplementing slow TradFi data which can take days by tracking flows on-chain. On Wednesday morning, James Van Straten of Cryptoslate reported that 18,400 bitcoin were sent from Grayscale to Coinbase‚Äôs Prime OTC desk right at market open, following a pattern of outflows on the two previous trading days of 9,000 bitcoin on January 16 and 4,000 bitcoin on January 12. The on-chain data from intelligence firm Arkham is trustworthy, the problem is it doesn‚Äôt match the reported outflows. Those three days of on-chain data add up to $1.3 billion worth of bitcoin and the reported outflows were only $1.1 billion. Also, interestingly there were no transactions the morning on January 18, but they resumed this morning.\n\nSource: Arkham via @DylanLeClair_ Coinbase already custodies Grayscale‚Äôs bitcoin, so these are transfers from their custody account to the OTC desk, where other ETF market makers can pick it up, limiting the effect on the spot price.GBTC Selling Could Be Drawing to a CloseGrayscale selling was expected but we still don‚Äôt know the ultimate amount that will end up being sold by the time the dust settles. Will 100% of their coins slowly come out, or perhaps only 10%? People are speculating the expense ratio of 1.5% versus the other ETFs averaging 0.25% might cause people to swap ETFs. If that is the case, it would not translate into any net selling. GBTC did lower their fee when they converted, from 2% down to the new 1.5%. If GBTC holders are sitting on significant unrealized gains, they might choose not to sell until the next rally. Remember, there are tax implications with swapping, also.Many early sellers of GBTC are doing so for ideological reasons. The discount which formed in Feb 2021 took them by surprise and they felt stuck. The question is how many bitcoin is that? GBTC still has over 550,000 bitcoin as of January 19, how many of those still feel stuck? Why wouldn‚Äôt they have already swapped out in the first several trading days? I think it is less than people think. Yes, all of the bitcoin will come out eventually if they keep the expense ratio that high, but not in one sustained movement. I think the dumping will be spread out over several large rallies in the bull market. Selling from GBTC might already be slowing with the discount to NAV dropping from 150 bps on day 1 to 47 bps on January 17.Bitcoin PriceSpeaking of price, bitcoin has managed to hold support at $40,000 even with the massive outflows from GBTC and whale selling. Again, James Van Straten reports a whale who bought at $48,000 in 2021‚Äôs bull market, who held through the massive drawdown and the FTX debacle, possibly unloaded 100,000 BTC with an ask of $49,000. For context, all the ETFs ex-GBTC are still below that at 79,000 BTC. This was not a sell-the-news event, it could have simply been a whale selling after breaking even. Meaning the consistent buying pressure of the ETFs is only delayed by a week or so.\n\nWe are still in the range dating all the way back to the beginning of December, but are threatening to fall below it right now. My attention remains on $40,000 and the $44,193 line we've been watching that whole time, created from the high daily close back on December 8.For those readers with beautiful low time preference, the monthly Ichimoku cloud is flipping bullish. This is an extremely bullish signal that only happens at the beginning of bull runs in bitcoin. It occurred last in October 2020 after almost flipping prior to COVID in February 2020. Interestingly, if it would have flipped in February, it would be at very nearly the same relation to the halving that we are today. Prior to 2020, the only other time this has occurred was in June 2016, at the beginning of that massive bull market, and one month prior to the July 2016 halving. \n\nMassive Buying Pressure in ContextUsing the incomplete inflow data above, we can say that the average daily buying pressure, including GBTC selling, has been more than $200 million/day. Interesting that Day 4 was the second highest, adding some evidence to the theory that buying pressure might level out around the $250-300 million mark. To put that amount in context, Microstrategy just began a 4-month process of selling $216 million in new shares to buy more bitcoin. The ETFs do that in a day. Tether is also constantly buying bitcoin for their reserves. Recently, they reported adding another $380 million in bitcoin at the end of 2023. Two out of the first five days of the ETFs were more than that.With all those sources of gigantic demand in mind, look again at the monthly chart above, again. There is one way for this market to go.

        "content": "Hundreds of millions of Africans face two problems holding them back from progress: 600 million lack electricity, while virtually all 1.4 billion people on the continent lack high-quality currency. Compare this to the US, Northern Europe, or Japan, where nearly everyone has access to consistent, affordable power and a widely-accepted reserve currency like the dollar, euro, or yen.The longer that Africans suffer from power blackouts and high inflation, the harder it is for them to get a leg up, despite their best efforts. Worse still, legacy energy and financial providers have no incentive to alleviate this issue, meaning currency debasement, debt traps, and grid shutdowns persist. Most might look at this scenario and conclude that the next African century will be very difficult. Despite being blessed by abundant energy sources like mighty rivers, blazing sun, strong winds, and geothermal heat, Africa remains largely unable to harness these natural resources for its economic growth. A river might run through it, but human development in the region has been painfully reliant on charity or expensive foreign borrowing. Until now.In the eyes of some of the continent‚Äôs entrepreneurs, educators, and activists, something has emerged that has the potential to revolutionize access to reliable electricity and high-quality currency -- the building blocks of progress -- for Africa‚Äôs swiftly rising population.

Mulange, just outside the village of Malawi\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the region was hit hard by European and Arab slavery. Portugal, Oman, Britain, and other empires extracted hundreds of thousands of slaves from Mozambique, Malawi, and the surrounding areas to ship off to forced labor in the Americas and the Middle East through regional ports like Zanzibar. At best, 1 in 5 survived the journey. Slave routes passed right through Mt. Mulanje, which was an easily-identifiable marker along the way. Today, the mountain‚Äôs foothills are peppered with lush forests, encroaching tea plantations, and farmers growing pineapple, banana, and maize. The ecosystem is a world treasure, with endemic plants and animals including prehistoric cycads, the endangered national tree of Malawi, the Mulanje cedar, and some of the rarest insects and reptiles on earth.Sadly, the exploitation from long ago continues, just in different forms. Logging and mining threaten the local environment, and without industrial infrastructure, residents are isolated and left to fend for themselves.The population here may be gifted with many natural resources, but the mother of modern progress has eluded them. Only about 15% of Malawians ‚Äî and only about 5% of people living in the country‚Äôs rural areas ‚Äî have access to electricity. In Bondo, a small village in the foothills of Mt. Mulanje, some residents got their very first access to lights at night in 2016. ‚ÄúBefore then,‚Äù according to the town‚Äôs senior chief, ‚Äúthere was only darkness.‚ÄùThis lack of power creates several problems for a growing population. Instead of flipping on a stove, residents log the area around the mountain, cutting down trees and brush to make fires or to create charcoal for cooking. At night, children study under the light of dangerous paraffin lamps, or don‚Äôt study at all. The logging devastates the forest and the fires and lamps create noxious indoor air pollution. Foreign donors ‚Äî including the Scottish Government ‚Äî paid for a small hydroelectric plant for Bondo in 2008, and after eight long years of construction, it began to provide power for some of the local population.During that time, Carl Bruessow ‚Äî an avid hiker and the head of the Mt. Mulanje Conservation Trust ‚Äî helped start the Mulanje Electricity Generation Agency (Mega), Malawi‚Äôs first privately-owned micro-hydro energy provider. Mega is also a social enterprise with the mission of providing the citizens of Bondo with electricity. The raw cost of power from a small hydro scheme like the one financed by the Scots on the banks of a river on Mulanje is extremely high, nearing 90 cents per kilowatt-hour. For context, residential power in the US or Europe ranges from 10 cents to 20 cents per KwH. Grid power in Africa typically ranges from 20 cents to 40 cents per KwH. For example, in Kenya, it‚Äôs 27 cents. Carl, in his efforts to give back to the local community, heavily subsidized this cost for the residents of Bondo. Due to his generosity, they paid less than 20 cents per KwH to Mega for electricity.Carl covered the difference, but such an operation was not sustainable. Over 2,000 households had so far been connected to the Mega grid, but another 3,000 were still waiting for hookups to their homes, and Carl was running out of money. The power stations were producing more than enough power for 5,000 homes, but much of the electricity was orphaned and unable to be sold, as Mega did not have capital to be able to purchase the equipment to connect new households. There was no capital, either, to consider expansion so that the hydropower would not dwindle in the late summer during the dry season.In some places, industrial operations might buy orphaned rural power. But in a place like Bondo, there simply aren‚Äôt very many power-hungry businesses. The excess electricity couldn‚Äôt be sold, so the power stations built machines that existed solely to suck up the unused power. This was especially tragic when there was a lot of rain, or at times of low demand like at night, when the stations were forced to dissipate the overwhelming majority of their precious electricity: a total waste.Two years ago, entrepreneurs Erik Hersman, Janet Maingi, and Philip Walton launched Gridless, a new company focusing on off-grid Bitcoin mining in Africa. The trio had backgrounds with companies like Ushahidi, BRCK, and iHub, with expertise in building hardware, writing software, as well as scaling communications and internet infrastructure, giving them a fitting resume for the task. One of their first site visits was in Bondo, where they visited with Carl and inspected Bondo‚Äôs power stations. In early 2023, a Gridless Bitcoin datacenter was installed and launched, and now, Carl and Mega have a new source of capital. In December, I was able to travel to Bondo to figure out how it all works.\n\nGridless‚Äôs set-up at a Bondo micro-hydro generator\n\n\nOutflow from the power station\nToday, any and all excess power generated by Bondo‚Äôs power stations gets sold in real-time to the Bitcoin network by Gridless‚Äôs miners, and Carl earns 30% of that revenue. It arrives directly to Mega‚Äôs wallet, in BTC. The new capital is enabling Mega to connect more customers to power, drive costs down, and expand their operations, to eventually connect everyone in the Bondo region to electricity. Mega, the community, and Gridless all benefit. And the most profound part? No aid or government subsidy is required.Bitcoin is often framed by critics as a waste of energy. But in Bondo, like in so many other places around the world, it becomes blazingly clear that if you aren‚Äôt mining Bitcoin, you are wasting energy. What was once a pitfall is now an opportunity. Bitcoin miners can be thought of as dung beetles, scraping up the waste energy that no one else wants and transforming it into something valuable.As Mega hooks up more and more customers, Gridless may unplug some of their mining machines, and move elsewhere, or perhaps move to harness the output of new power generation stations in the same area that are waiting to connect to their clients. If the Bitcoin network pays X, customers will need to pay X+1, so eventually miners will start to get priced out. But even in a situation where at 5:00pm the local demand from Bondo eats close to full capacity of what‚Äôs available, mining can still be lucrative, because there‚Äôs so little demand overnight, and the river never sleeps.Elsewhere in Malawi, the national grid is broken. As of December 2023, people who receive grid power suffer from 6-8 hours of ‚Äúload shedding‚Äù per day, where huge swaths of the country‚Äôs population are cut off from power by the electricity company. But in Bondo, there is no load shedding. The mini-grid is properly balanced by the Bitcoin miners. If there‚Äôs not enough water power, Gridless‚Äôs automated software turns the ASICs off. If there‚Äôs too much water power from, for example, one of the tropical cyclones that periodically hammers the region, Gridless‚Äôs ASIC operation eats it up. It‚Äôs a small wonder that in little Bondo, the electricity works more consistently than in the big cities.One night during my visit to Bondo, Carl asked me to pause as the sunset was fading, to look at the hills around us: the lights were all turning on, all across the foothills of Mt. Mulanje. It was a powerful sight to see, and staggering to think that Bitcoin is helping to make it happen as it converts wasted energy into human progress.The potential for this model to scale is mind-boggling. Consider: power generation in Africa is typically planned looking forward, for example, on a 30-year window. So sites are built to provide future capacity, not the capacity of today. So when a site like the one in Bondo boots up, it takes a while before it can get from 0% to even 20% capacity. At that point, before Bitcoin, the power company might have had to charge 5 times the price for the electricity it sold, just to make itself whole. This is catastrophic for customers, especially those like the ones in Bondo who have some of the smallest disposable incomes on the continent. But with Bitcoin, the network now buys 100% of the all available excess electricity, bringing costs down even if only a small percentage of the power station‚Äôs capacity is being purchased by residential or industrial consumers.We are told to believe that progress is always happening and that pure human innovation is going to make things better and cheaper. But in Malawi, given the collapse of the local kwacha currency, and the lack of incentives for infrastructure investment, the expansion of the electricity grid has not just been stalled, it has been made prohibitive. Bitcoin fixes this in two ways: by directly delivering a high-quality, peer-to-peer currency to the power generators, and by allowing them to use all of their capacity, all of the time, lowering prices for their customers and raising their profits.\n\n\n\nMEGA‚Äôs foreign donors, who finance capex but not opex, now being replaced by Bitcoin mining\nRoughly 95% of all small power generation in rural Africa, according to Erik, is funded with concessional financing, whereas it could take five to seven years to raise funds from charity. The process is dependent on altruism and the subsidy is someone else ‚Äúdoing the right thing.‚Äù The micro-hydro stations in Bondo, for example, were paid for by foreign donors, who can be very helpful for getting a project off the ground but who typically don‚Äôt pick up the bill for ongoing operation costs or expansion. They also don‚Äôt have very much skin in the game, and are OK with an eight-year timeframe for getting people online. With Bitcoin, the incentives are different. Out with the donors, in with co-investors, who are very interested in getting the power up and running as soon as possible.Moving forward, there‚Äôs much work to do in Bondo. Carl and Mega are currently determining how to leverage their new income stream from the Bitcoin network to connect up hundreds of new homes to electricity. They are also considering an expansion to a new, larger power station to address the issue of lower power output in the two driest months of the year. It would, of course, be built in partnership with Gridless, so that it could start generating revenue immediately, on day one, even if it takes time to connect new homes and businesses.The critical importance of electricity was underlined when we met Bondo‚Äôs community leaders and members of the residents‚Äô electricity committee. They listed all of the new benefits that the town now receives: they used to have to walk 20 kilometers for things like corn mills, or televisions, or refrigeration, or to charge phones, or for their kids to study at night, or for healthcare, and now they don‚Äôt. The ladies in our meeting even pointed out a funny thing: before, the men of the village would go to town to watch football at night, leaving their families behind. But today, they don‚Äôt leave, they just watch it at home and are there for their wives and children. LEDs replace kerosene lamps, reducing fire risk and deadly indoor air pollution. The percentage of children that go on to higher levels of schooling has increased, dramatically. The list of life upgrades goes on and on.By this point you might be saying, fine, this sounds good, but why not do something else with the electricity generated by Bondo‚Äôs rivers? Philip explains that no other business would run better in a place like this, blessed by cheap energy but isolated from infrastructure. The cost of AI farming, for example, is only in a small way dictated by electricity: a chip might cost $30,000 and use 1200 watts. Contrast this to Bitcoin mining, where electricity makes up a huge portion of cost, and a chip might cost $1,200 and use 3500 watts. So it makes no economic sense to build an AI data center in Bondo, not to mention the connectivity, bandwidth, and latency issues. Moreover, AI processes cannot be simply turned on and off like Bitcoin mining without causing some kind of harm to the service itself, so AI compute, in its current form, cannot be a grid balancer. But Bitcoin can: when the microgrid needs to deploy electricity elsewhere, miners can turn off easily. Finally, even if Mega tried to service AI companies in Bondo, how would they get paid? It would be the same trap of foreign exchange problems, fees, and dealing with the collapsing local currency. With Bitcoin, they get paid in globally-accepted, 24/7 saleable satoshis.One more area of potential is the externality of Bitcoin mining: heat. When we put our hands over the air exhaust coming out of the back of the Gridless facility in Bondo, we felt a searing blast. The more miners, the more heat. A miner is in essence a space heater, and a surprisingly efficient one at that. A new Reason documentary helps explain this, focusing on a bathhouse in Brooklyn, where the owner is now paying less every month in electricity bills to heat his spa water with ASICs than he did using more traditional heating equipment. Any heating operation that is not mining Bitcoin is probably wasting energy. 1,000 miles to the north of Bondo, in the D.R. Congo‚Äôs spectacular Virunga National Park, rangers have been mining Bitcoin with stranded hydropower for the past three years, generating critical income for the bioreserve and the five million people who live nearby. This coming March, the heat from Virunga‚Äôs miners will be harnessed to dry cocoa beans. Traditionally, this is done by laying out the beans to roast under the sun, where they are vulnerable to the weather, and to being eaten or stolen by animals. Drying the beans with the hot blast from the miners will dramatically expedite the process, and for minimal additional cost.Instead of spending $200,000 on an industrial drying operation, the park rangers simply bought $200,000 worth of ASICs that can process cocoa and earn Bitcoin. Moving forward, if any of their competitors process cocoa and don‚Äôt mine Bitcoin, they will be wasting energy, and they will be less competitive.\n\nCocoa beans drying in Virunga today. Soon, they will be dried by Bitcoin mining heat\nAccording to environmentalist and Bitcoin advocate Troy Cross, in the last Bitcoin price cycle that crescendoed in late 2021, mining was driven by access to cheap capital, not cheap power. For example: Wall Street borrowing cheaply to buy shares in Bitcoin mining companies.But in the next cycle, he says, it will be driven by access to cheap power. And this could tilt in Africa‚Äôs favor. There might even be places, he says, where the cost to mine, let‚Äôs say in Blantyre, exceeds the mining benefit, but the business savings from the excess heat (selling chocolate) makes the whole thing profitable. Really, he says, one should think in terms of: profit from mining plus profit from heat minus the cost of mining. Anywhere where one finds low grade electrical heat, there are unrealized Bitcoin profits.In Bondo, Mega‚Äôs original idea was to make dried pineapple snacks using the excess heat. But on our visit, a new idea was hatched: the mine itself is on a tea plantation. Tea, once picked, needs to be dried within a matter of hours, and it is done so with heaters, which suck up electricity. Why not use ASICs to dry the tea? The operators are now thinking about it. In a place where electricity is typically exceedingly scarce, it‚Äôs a luxury to think about and consider what to do with extra power, but it‚Äôs happening in Bondo now that there‚Äôs a technology that allows people to harness value that was once just blown out the window.II. The Collapse of the KwachaOne Wednesday morning in November 2023, the 20 million citizens of Malawi woke up to find their currency devalued by 44%. The government and IMF argued that the move would boost exports and stabilize the economy, but for the average person, all they felt was an immediate decrease in purchasing power. Many merchants simply closed for the day, as employees needed time to recreate the price labels used everywhere from gas stations to grocery stores.This was not, like in Argentina, something that most people could escape. In Argentina, there is a widely accessible and sophisticated black market for dollars. In Malawi, this doesn‚Äôt exist. People are stuck in the kwacha. According to the country‚Äôs Reserve Bank, 85% of Malawians are unbanked, meaning nearly everyone uses paper kwacha notes issued by the government as their main store of value and medium of exchange. Devaluation here remains an effective way to steal from the population.\n\nA rural street market outside Blantyre, a few weeks after the country‚Äôs massive currency devaluation\nIf one were to design the perfect weapon, something that could hurt everyone in a country at the same time, it‚Äôs hard to think of a better one than currency devaluation. Unlike a nuclear blast or bioweapon, it can hurt every single person simultaneously. In this case, the damage was an immediate 44% reduction in the purchasing power and standard of living for millions of people in Malawi, especially the poorer and middle classes who cannot easily access dollars.It is not as if the government held a referendum, asking the public to vote on whether they wanted their purchasing power to collapse the following week: of course, no one would agree. Devaluation has to be planned and orchestrated mostly in secret, and it tends to be overnight phenomena. So despite the status of Malawi as a partly free country, with relatively free and fair elections, the devaluation was entirely undemocratic. This is part of a larger global issue where financial repression is ignored, even though political repression is discussed and highlighted.Devaluations, for example, tend to be relegated to the back page of the newspaper, cast as a procedural matter. But they inflict grievous harm. It is a wonder why devaluation is not considered a crime, or even a crime against humanity. The people of Malawi did resist, in a series of protests. These small uprisings were put down, often brutally, by police. And ultimately, the marchers were forced to give up and accept the theft. This wasn‚Äôt the first time that the public was robbed of its labor and wages at scale, either: over the past 20 years, the kwacha has lost 95% of its value against the dollar, much of it in planned devaluations like this one.As we drove through the markets and farms near Blantyre, it was clear that the hard-working people around us did not need such a devaluation. They were already some of the poorest in the world. Malawi‚Äôs per capita income, according to the United Nations, hovers around $650 per year. That‚Äôs 33 cents per hour, assuming a nine-to-five, five-day work week. And that is, of course, the median rate. For people living in remote areas, it‚Äôs probably much closer to $100 per year or 5 cents per hour. And now, each hour of their effort only gets them 56% as much grain, fruit, meat, airtime, electricity, medicine, private schooling, or petrol as it did two months ago.This particular devaluation, like so many others, was a result of foreign pressure from the IMF and World Bank, who want client countries to pass through austerity before receiving any fresh new funds. Austerity is a euphemism for weakening the currency, ending subsidies on basic goods, shrinking welfare, raising taxes, crushing unions, harming small local businesses, and creating more favorable conditions for large multinational corporations and buyers of any locally harvested, excavated, or produced goods.After completing the late 2023 devaluation and pleasing its creditors, Malawi received the green light for a $137 million World Bank loan, as well as a new loan of $175 million from the IMF. $115 million of these loans have already been paid out as of early December: a Christmas bailout for the country‚Äôs corrupt bureaucrats. The IMF projects that Malawi will need $1 billion in debt relief over the next three years, ensuring that a lot more currency devaluation is on the horizon. Word on the street is that another devaluation, perhaps another 25%, is coming.\n\nOfficial statement from Airtel, one of Malawi‚Äôs largest companies, about losses related to the collapse of the kwacha\nThe macro impact on the country‚Äôs economy has already been huge: Airtel, one of the country‚Äôs largest mobile operators, posted a statement at the end of 2023 that the company‚Äôs profit is expected to be 100% less than the profit posted in 2022. ‚ÄúThe adverse deviation,‚Äù they write, ‚Äúhas arisen from the impact of the foreign exchange loss‚Ä¶ because the Malawi Kwacha has lost 66% of its value to the United States Dollar since June 2023 to date.‚Äù Citizens might have stopped protesting in the streets against this disaster, but some are finding other, more quiet ways to wage a revolution.Grant Gombwa is a student living in the Blantyre region, and is one of the country‚Äôs first Bitcoin meetup organizers. He loves the idea of a currency that no government can devalue. Malawi‚Äôs first official Bitcoin meetup will take place in February in the capital, Lilongwe. Grant will make the 5-hour drive to unite with perhaps two dozen other Bitcoiners. It‚Äôs a modest start, but given the economic conditions, it‚Äôs likely a trickle in what will eventually become a flood of new Bitcoin users. Grant said that, personally, what inspires him is that before he was stuck, unable to pay for anything abroad with his native currency. But today he has an upgrade, and can speak the same monetary language as someone in New York, Cairo, or Beijing.Grant estimated that among young people in Malawi, between 18 and 30 years old, that nearly all of them owned a phone, and that around two-thirds owned smartphones. Not all smartphone users can afford consistent data, of course, but that doesn‚Äôt prevent them from using Bitcoin. As we‚Äôll learn more about later in this story, Africans in countries like Malawi can use a service called Machankura to send or receive Bitcoin from any feature phone, or any smartphone with no data: no internet required. This means that an economic escape route is here ‚Äì it just will take Grant and other local educators some time to show people the way.In one of our conversations, Grant explained a potentially promising idea. The Malawian government, he said, with incentives from foreign lenders, is installing electric vehicle charging stations across the country. He guesses that very few locals will actually be able to afford these types of cars, especially in the first few years. So these solar-powered electric generators will be for the most part sitting, unused, wasting the sun‚Äôs energy. Enter Bitcoin.Grant‚Äôs idea is to bring a few ASICs to these likely-idle charge-points, hook them up, earn some satoshis, and pay a percentage to the owner of the property to make sure he doesn‚Äôt get kicked out. We‚Äôll see if Grant‚Äôs idea gets traction. But what‚Äôs certain is that there will be many more ideas like it, springing out of places like Blantyre and Bondo now that wasted energy can be turned into capital.III. Turning Fire into Digital GoldThe Great Rift Valley is one of the largest areas of seismic and volcanic activity on earth. The geothermal energy potential in this part of Africa, stretching 7,000 kilometers south from the Red Sea to Mozambique, is vast and nearly entirely untapped.\n\nA 1.4 megawatt geothermal power station near Lake Naivasha, Kenya\nTo get a sense of the potential that Bitcoin mining could have on the region, I visited a site a few hours outside of Nairobi, Kenya, on the shores of Lake Naivasha. The situation is representative of any number of industrial operations in rural Africa, or for that matter, in rural places anywhere in the world. A 1.4 megawatt geothermal plant (which funnels hot steam rising out of a 2,000 meter-deep hole through a turbine to generate electricity) powers a water pump perhaps a kilometer away on the shores of the lake. The pump pushes the lakewater up to a nearby complex of fields, where flowers are grown and exported to supermarkets in Europe. This is just one such flower farm in a country full of them: Kenya is the world‚Äôs largest flower exporter, and all of those fields need irrigation, and all of that irrigation needs power.Here‚Äôs the thing: these water pumps do not consume power in a consistent way. But geothermal power is always on, hinting at a tremendous amount of electricity waste just waiting for someone (or something) to come and buy it up. Geothermal is probably the single best existing power source in the world for Bitcoin mining. Hydro is great, but during dry months, it can slow down. Nuclear might be better in a vacuum, but it‚Äôs impractical at the moment for small sites, and at least a decade away from a rollout across Africa. Geothermal is 100% clean and 100% consistent. A plant like the one here in Naivasha could run for 40 years, with no interruptions, and no change in power output. It‚Äôs one of many that make up a total of 1 gigawatts (i.e. one thousand megawatts) of power generation just in this region alone. The foreman in charge of the site tells us that the surrounding hills and valleys could actually support up to 10GW of geothermal electricity, but the rest remains untapped.\n\n\n\nA peek at the 144 Whatsminer ASICs inside the custom-built shipping container\nDown at the pump, we see something that could soon be present at any industrial operation in the African countryside: a small shack, with a Starlink on top emitting a strong hum. Inside are 144 Whatsminer ASICs, set up, neatly corded, and run by Gridless. Everything from the hut itself to the software is custom-made in Africa by Africans. It‚Äôs a 500-kilowatt operation, which is about perfect, according to Erik, for a situation like this. He shows me the actual electricity used by the ASICs on his cellphone: about 375KW on average, every day. This is projectable into the future. Gridless has done a 5-year backstudy on Bitcoin mining revenue, and can predict being paid between 7 and 9 cents per kilowatt hour by the Bitcoin network. If the BTC price goes up, the earnings get beaten back down by the new mining competition. If the BTC price goes down, it becomes easier to mine: the difficulty adjustment in action.\n\nGridless‚Äôs Erik Hersman showing the electricity used by their miners on a typical day. On average, around 375 kilowatt-hours\nThe upfront cost for a set-up like the one on Lake Naivasha runs in the low six-figures including the ASICs and other infrastructure. Daily revenue for the Bitcoin mine will be a few hundred dollars. Gridless pays out 30% of the revenue to the power company as a flat fee for the right to use the stranded electricity. Depending on the consistency of the excess energy, Gridless generally recovers their investment within a few years.One can quickly see how Bitcoin mining is going to be enormously profitable across Africa. ‚ÄúIf you know you are building a variable-demand power station in the future, you will incorporate Bitcoin mining from the start,‚Äù says Erik. ‚ÄúOtherwise, you are wasting energy.‚Äù Storing the energy in batteries and using it later sounds like a nice idea, but doesn‚Äôt make economic or technological sense right now, he says. Imagine a slightly larger 2-megawatt operation similar to the one at Lake Naivasha, that could be $1,000,000 in gross revenue per year, and not in kwacha or shillings, but in cold hard satoshis, payable directly to the site, no accounting office or foreign exchange costs required.The scene by the lake is perfectly solarpunk: the earth‚Äôs heat is powering agriculture, and the Bitcoin mine is eliminating any electricity waste, and converting it instead into digital gold. It‚Äôs sitting here in a place like this that you realize that not Bitcoin mining is such a staggering waste of energy.Later, as I talk with the Gridless team about the implications of the Lake Naivasha site at a restaurant in Nairobi, the power goes out during our meal. Janet tells me that this is typical in Kenya but that Bitcoin can help fix this, as a demand response technology. ‚ÄúDuring the day, there‚Äôs a lot of demand, and we turn off our machines,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúAt night, when people go to sleep, we turn on our machines. Normally, if there‚Äôs too much unplugging too fast, it can cause blackouts. But we can balance the grid with more Bitcoin mining. We can absorb sudden incoming power, and we can slow sudden collapses of power by turning off.‚Äù ASICs can be turned on and off at a moment‚Äôs notice without harm to the operator, unlike manufacturing or other compute processes, making Bitcoin mining one of the best technologies in the world for stabilizing grids. What Gridless is doing at small scale with offgrid energy could also help the national grids struggling all across the continent.Micro-hydro and geothermal aren‚Äôt the only power sources that Gridless is tracking. Solar, they say, only provides energy during one third of the day, and requires expensive battery technology to be viable. Such batteries could triple the cost of operating a power site, making it far less appealing. Gridless does have its eye on a few wind sites, but another option is biomass energy. In the past weeks, the company has brought two new East African Bitcoin mining sites online, powered by biomass. One new mine adorns a sugar processing facility, and one complements a plant that refines sisal, a tough fiber used for rugs, rope, and other textiles. In both cases, the leftover plant material is burned and the heat boils water to power a turbine, generating electricity. In both cases, as is the case for most African industrial operations, the site is too far from any residential communities to directly power homes or other businesses. Often, the electricity is simply just run straight back into the ground.Biomass is generally considered clean and renewable: sisal and sugar plants suck carbon dioxide from the air into their constituent parts, and then when they are burned, that carbon is released back into the sky. Sisal and sugar production is widespread in East and South Africa, and yet the excess power typically goes to waste.Phillip explains that even in the case where a power generation piece is added to a sisal or sugar refinery, the operators can‚Äôt usually produce electricity unless about 70% of the capacity is used: otherwise the boiler malfunctions. In the case of the sugar refinery, there was no one close enough to buy the power. In the case of the sisal farm, the power generation feature was simply never turned on. Again: enter Bitcoin. With Gridless technology, these power stations are now running at close to full capacity, and saving the previously orphaned electricity, turning it into capital.‚ÄúASICs will become an integrated component of any energy site,‚Äù says Philip. ‚ÄúA turbine, a transformer, and a mining container. This is just what you will do. If you don‚Äôt, you won‚Äôt be competitive. You‚Äôll be wasting energy.‚ÄùIV. Bitcoin Without InternetAs of 2023, some 600 million Africans lacked internet access. More than half the continent is still offline. Starlink makes what Gridless does possible, and innovative companies like BRCK continue to expand internet access in rural places. But what good can Bitcoin do for the average citizen of a country like Malawi, where only a fraction of the population is online?Ten years ago, Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopolous wondered: what if Africa could leapfrog banks, just like it had leapfrogged landline telephones? What if people just used their phones to access Bitcoin-powered financial services? He even wondered: could this be possible without internet access?As fate would have it, an entrepreneur named Kgothatso Ngako born in Mamelodi, a township outside of Pretoria originally built by the apartheid government of South Africa, would come up with a solution.\n\nKgothatso Ngako\nNgako -- or ‚ÄúKG‚Äù as he is commonly known -- was working as a computer scientist at the Council for Science and Industrial Research in Pretoria about 8 years ago when his boss gave him a new assignment: research Bitcoin.KG was once offered a $1,000 payment in Bitcoin in 2016 for a remote gig (1.3 BTC then, worth more than $50,000 today), but took the payment in PayPal instead. Why? He couldn‚Äôt use Bitcoin for anything. The CSIR study he worked on rekindled his interest, but ultimately the researchers concluded that blockchain technology was the thing that had merit, not Bitcoin.In 2017, Bitcoin‚Äôs price shot up and KG, like many others, finally took a harder look. But what initially attracted his interest was the galaxy of crypto tokens that sprouted up around Bitcoin. By early 2018, when the next bear market began to hit, he was trading a dizzying array of tokens on Binance. He had a bunch of altcoins that had lost so much value they couldn‚Äôt even be traded on the engine, so KG visited a ‚Äúdust page‚Äù to convert them into Binance‚Äôs native BNB token and from there he converted to BTC. He eventually did enough reading and research and had seen enough: he wanted to start saving in and working in Bitcoin, not other digital currencies. Warren Buffet in particular had inspired him: what will gain value over 30 years, thought KG? Bitcoin, he thought, and maybe not so much the other tokens.The first Bitcoin project KG created was Exonumia, named after an old word for the study of currencies and numismatics. In 2018, he wasn‚Äôt ready to contribute to Bitcoin with code, but at least, he thought, he could introduce the idea to more people. Exonumia is an African-wide translation platform, still in operation today, that puts Bitcoin educational materials into dozens of African languages from Berber to Malagasy to Shona. The key, KG said, was the architecture of the translation itself. Most people would try to automate translations using software. But that wasn‚Äôt the full point of the mission. Building a human network was the real goal. So KG did it the ‚Äúslow way‚Äù and would recruit people from various countries in Africa and pay them to do the work. Over time, he got to know Bitcoiners in dozens of places across the continent. In 2019, he expanded this network by hosting regular spaces on Twitter and inviting anyone in Africa with an interest in Bitcoin. People would message him out of the blue on the Exonumia account, with new ideas, from new countries, and new projects were born.After his CSIR job, KG took a role at AWS. But ultimately, the work there felt like it was taking him further away from the things he found interesting. It was, as he says, completely disconnected from the realities of life back in the South African townships where he grew up. Exomunia seemed so much more important. At the end of 2020, he decided to quit the corporate world and work full-time on freedom technology. The first software project that he spun up was a VPN, called ContentConnect.Net. Privacy is hugely important to KG. Not that long ago, he says, South Africans lived under a dictatorial state of surveillance and control. He pointed out that Steve Biko published his famous ‚ÄúI Write What I Like‚Äù essays under a pseudonym: once the authorities found out he was the author, they put him on trial and killed him. Everyone can be a hero, KG says, but if they feel like it‚Äôs too risky, they won‚Äôt take the biggest steps. So creating a privacy-boosting VPN accessible to Africans was a worthy goal.KG‚Äôs next project was a software solution to what he saw as one of the biggest barriers to Bitcoin adoption in Africa: the lack of internet access. 10 years ago, he was part of an MIT Global Startup Labs effort working on mobile money in South Africa. The problem was that the mobile money system was fragmented, and they wanted to try to bridge the different types of credits that people used across the country. This is where he started tinkering with USSD: a protocol for communication over text messaging, no internet required. In May of 2022, a Namibian Bitcoiner wrote ‚ÄúThere has got to be a way to get a Bitcoin wallet onto a non-smartphone mobile phone. Someone out there is definitely smart enough to figure this out. I believe in you.‚Äù KG quickly responded: ‚ÄúGive me 2 weeks.‚Äù He was ready. He had taken a pay cut (known as a ‚Äúsoul dividend‚Äù) when he left Amazon to work on his VPN, but was more energized than ever to work on Bitcoin.A few days after his famous tweet, with the experience from the MIT challenge a decade ago in mind, he launched Machankura, referring to the South African slang term for money. The new service would allow feature phone users -- or smartphone users with no data -- to send, receive, and save Bitcoin. Some of the biggest challenges that Machankura overcomes are in the UX area: traditionally, to use Bitcoin, people need to copy and paste an address, or read a QR code. But feature phones in general do not have these capabilities. KG‚Äôs tool would also need to use Lightning, to overcome the increasingly high on-chain fees, but USSD has a 182 character limit, so lengthy Lightning invoices were not going to fit. The solution was to adopt the Lightning Address, a mechanism invented by the Brazilian software engineers Andre Neves and Fiatjaf, which gives Machankura users an email-based, human-readable identity. For example: [your phone number]@8333.mobi.\n\nMachankura in action: Bitcoin without internet\nToday, Machankura users can send Bitcoin to each other using phone numbers or Lightning Address ‚Äúusernames.‚Äù They can also use on-chain addresses or Lightning invoices, assuming their phones have copy-paste functionality, but the former two options are dominant. To fire up the service, a user dials a number from their phone, generating a text response with various options, a decision-tree of sorts. To send, press 1, etc. From here a user can do a variety of things with Bitcoin with no internet.One powerful functionality is the overlap with Azteco, a voucher service. So for example, KG might go into a convenience store in South Africa, and with cash buy a voucher called OneVoucher. In Kenya someone might buy a similar voucher using MPESA. It‚Äôs a 16-digit code with a certain amount of value on it, and this code can be entered into the Machankura menu. On the back end, what KG and team are doing is buying an Azteco voucher with the 16-digit code, and crediting the account of the Machankura user. This allows Machankura users to easily ‚Äútop up‚Äù their Bitcoin account using cash or MPESA credits. Machankura also has an API to Bitrefill, so any product available on Bitrefill can be sold on the app‚Äôs user interface. Availability ranges by country but when they go to option 4 inside the app, they can barter for goods and services: for example, airtime or grocery vouchers. What this means is today, as we begin the year 2024, Machankura‚Äôs user base of 12,000 Africans are able to send and receive value globally, buy mobile minutes, buy vouchers for gas or petrol, purchase electricity (through pre-paid vouchers), or trade into cash, all using Bitcoin, with no internet. KG‚Äôs dream is starting to be realized.Of course, big challenges remain. One is scaling across the entire African continent. Right now, KG works with services like Africas Talking to access different telecom networks. In that model, Machankura pays a monthly fee to Africas Talking for airtime, instead of the users paying the telecom directly. The scaling is a slow but steady process, but is happening, even in places like Malawi. A second challenge is custody. At the moment, Machankura is a custodial service. Meaning: they hold your Bitcoin. Not your keys, not your coins. So even though it‚Äôs a very useful tool, it‚Äôs not actually giving property rights to its users. But, in the coming month, Machankura is planning to release a proof-of-concept that allows users to self-custody. If it works smoothly, it will be one of the biggest innovations in Bitcoin‚Äôs history, allowing people without the internet to actually be their own bank.The trick, KG says, is that a SIM card is a computational platform that can store things. It can, for example, sign Bitcoin transactions, or interface with the Lightning Network. He is incentivized to push Machankura in this direction for the mission of human freedom, but also, for business reasons: they don‚Äôt want to grow as big as MPesa, and be liable for all user funds, and to carry so much counterparty risk. This way, when KG goes to Vodaphone to pitch a partnership for tens of millions of new users, he can say: how would you like to introduce your users to Bitcoin, with no counterparty risk? It‚Äôs a much easier ‚Äúyes‚Äù than if he were to say: let‚Äôs introduce your users to Bitcoin, but you have to hold all the funds, and deal with those regulations and laws and responsibilities.In the West, Bitcoin adoption might mean the centralizing forces of large on-grid mining operations and ETFs. But the amazing irony is that in Africa, Bitcoin‚Äôs technology arc is making the currency more and more decentralized. As the network eats more and more off-grid cheap electricity, at dozens of completely separated sites, it becomes harder and harder to shut down. And as the network adds more and more self-custodial users on potentially millions and millions of SIM cards, it becomes more and more unstoppable. As Lyn Alden describes in her book, Broken Money, up to this point modern monetary technology was inexorably centralizing as it became more digital and more advanced. Bitcoin breaks this trend, and Africa helps Bitcoin break it.And as Africa helps Bitcoin, Bitcoin helps Africans. KG says that some Machankura users started with feature phones, and then, after getting involved in the Bitcoin economy, bought themselves a smartphone. They are pulling themselves into the internet using Bitcoin. And others through Gridless are pulling themselves into electricity using Bitcoin. Together, they are moving into the future.V. Bridging the Gender GapThere are 700 million African women. All of them, according to Marcel Lorraine, could one day be Bitcoin users. Marcel, a Kenyan entrepreneur and social activist, has made it her life mission to onboard the women of Africa into a new currency system that they (not their husbands) can control, and that can meaningfully improve their own freedom.Her journey began in 2018, when she was doing a gig in Nairobi and struggling with her finances. She was running Loryce, her company that consults for corporate and social events. She would save her earnings, she says, but then at the end of the year have less and less to show for it. The government, she says, kept raising taxes. And her only option was to save in a shilling bank account, which kept depreciating rapidly. For context, while not as weak as the kwacha, the Kenyan shilling depreciated 21% against the dollar in 2023, which itself also depreciated against goods and services. In the end, Kenyans are getting at least 25% less stuff for their wages than one year ago.\n\nMarcel Lorraine in action: orange-pilling African women\nAt the gig, Marcel heard about cryptocurrency and decentralized finance. ‚ÄúCan I be paid in that,‚Äù she asked herself, ‚Äúto save me from the hassle of fees and inflation?‚Äù At that time, she said, there was a ridiculous amount of hype around blockchain in Kenya. There were tons of scams, and tons of promoted events around different tokens. During that time there were no educational hubs or groups: you‚Äôd show up at an event and hope it wasn‚Äôt pitching a scam. ‚ÄúI invested in a variety of tokens,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúincluding Bitcoin. I made money. I lost money. It was frustrating.‚ÄùDuring the COVID pandemic, she couldn‚Äôt do event production, so she was day trading shillings and dollars. She decided to focus on Bitcoin, because she didn‚Äôt have time to study more than one type of investment, and besides, as she says, it is the mother of digital currencies.In 2022, Marcel helped organize the first post-pandemic Bitcoin event in Kenya in April at a Nairobi hotel at a conference room full of Bitcoiners. Attendees included local educators Rufas Kamau and Master Guantai, and even Paco de la India, who was passing through on his journey to travel the world only using Bitcoin. At that event Marcel noticed a problem: there were a lot of men but only two women, and she was one of the two. She had noticed that crypto and blockchain events had a gender gap, perhaps only 30% women. But 98-2 for Bitcoin? ‚ÄúWe could do better,‚Äù she said. So she reached out to a few female friends, who told her that they were afraid to go to Bitcoin events, because the environment felt male dominated. OK fine, she thought: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a problem and I can make a solution.‚ÄùMarcel created Bitcoin DADA in 2022 as a safe space for girls and women to learn about financial freedom. The first cohort was held in May, with 20 people, just her circle of friends. Ever since, she has run online classes every Tuesday and Thursday at 9:00pm. At first, it was just Kenyan females. In the second cohort, they had 40 students. Each cohort is 6 weeks long. Now, she says, they have held five cohorts, and more than 300 women have gone through the course, with a total of 130 graduates. All of them now have a solid understanding of Bitcoin. They know how to self-custody and buy Bitcoin with no KYC via cash trades.On our way through Nairobi, I watch as Marcel effortlessly uses Bitnob and Machankura to buy Bitcoin with MPESA, and then send Bitcoin without using any data. I think of how people on Wall Street or Silicon Valley would be blown away by this feat, which she makes look so simple. Marcel normally suggests a range of wallets in her course, including the self-custodial Muun and Phoenix, and the custodial Wallet of Satoshi for small transactions.For on ramps, Marcel typically recommends the Nigerian-founded Bitnob app. Students, like everyone in Kenya, have MPESA, and use Bitnob to swap that for Bitcoin and then withdraw to, for example, a Muun wallet. Kenya is much more developed than Malawi, but many smartphone users still don‚Äôt have consistent data, rendering Machankura also a key tool. For the main curriculum, Marcel uses the Mi Primer Bitcoin book (originally created in El Salvador) and then she walks students through practical examples of why it‚Äôs important for African females to become Bitcoiners.Back in 2022, Marcel first heard about the Africa Bitcoin Conference. The Austrian educator Anita Posch approached Marcel and asked if she was going: no, Marcel said, it was too expensive. But Anita insisted and helped organize a fundraiser, and contributed half while the community covered the rest. On her visit to Accra in December 2022, Marcel was inspired by what the conference organizer and Togolese human rights activist Farida Nabourema had created. In 2023, Marcel came back to the second edition of the conference with 4 ladies, and Bitcoin DADA helped two female-led teams enter the event‚Äôs hackathon. Marcel now offers a mentorship program which helps the ladies speak in their own capacities, whether on social media or at events like ABC, to help them tell their own stories.On the ground, Marcel visits universities and runs trainings for women and men together. Students are vulnerable because they are often targeted by scams. She describes the obscene lengths that WorldCoin went to try and sucker students into buying and trading their token in Kenya. Bitcoin, she points out, has no similar marketing budget. Teaching and training the youth, she says, is underfunded and vitally important. Every single person that attended one of her events at a university recently had been targeted by WorldCoin: a brutal reality.Marcel‚Äôs goals are to streamline DADA‚Äôs mentorship program so that they can match talent and skill for Bitcoin companies, to help get women hired in the space, and also to expand to different countries. Several of her mentees have already earned jobs or fellowships in the Bitcoin ecosystem, at organizations like Btrust or ABC. She says they now have 30 active alumni in Uganda now, and more in Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania.\n\n\n\nMarcel‚Äôs students: new self-sovereign Bitcoin users\n‚ÄúFor me,‚Äù Marcel says, ‚ÄúBitcoin gives us back our voices. It‚Äôs hard being African, and harder being an African female. This gives us financial independence and an opportunity to work on ourselves.‚ÄùMarcel has long supported one particular school in Nairobi‚Äôs Kibera, the largest urban slum in Africa. She has personally seen Bitcoin help people escape. She knows it can help get many many more, but the hard work needs to be done.Her mission seems a tall order: going from what is now probably just a few thousand African female Bitcoiners to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, and eventually, hundreds of millions. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt do this,‚Äù Marcel says, ‚Äúthen I would have failed my sisters. Finance is thought to be a man‚Äôs thing, so women get financially abused. I don‚Äôt want to leave the women behind.‚ÄùBitcoin, she says, gives a way out of macro problems like currency devaluation, and micro problems like repression inside the home. A lot of foreign aid, she says, doesn‚Äôt make it to the slums. Bitcoin helps because it makes sure the money gets directly where it needs to be: ‚ÄúWe eliminate the waste and corruption.‚ÄùOn my last night in Nairobi, I meet Felix, a local Bitcoin entrepreneur. Like many others I met, he‚Äôs now running a Bitcoin business, in his case selling merchandise, and is earning in satoshis. He explains how the Lightning integration at Binance has been huge for Kenyans, as now they can interface with Wallet of Satoshi, Phoenix, Machankura, and other apps instantly with very low fees. He says how Binance p2p is also being used widely to trade from MPESA to Bitcoin. I ask him about Marcel, and he raves about her work. He says that it‚Äôs essential to get women involved in Bitcoin adoption, and that Marcel is doing god‚Äôs work in this area. ‚ÄúShe is,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbridging the gap.‚ÄùVI. African Producers, not ConsumersBitcoin mining might help provide electricity to millions of Africans, but if the proceeds aren‚Äôt spendable in a local economy, and usable by all citizens, then it‚Äôs just a partial revolution. If one challenge for popular Bitcoin adoption in Africa is the lack of internet, and another is low use among women, then another, according to Femi Longe, is breaking the cycle of dependence on the West.Femi is a Nigerian social entrepreneur with 20 years of experience mentoring African technologists and start-up founders, and played a key role in creating and running the two most important tech hubs in Nigeria and Kenya. In 2022 he was hired to lead the Qala Fellows, an initiative from Tim Akinbo, Carla Kirk-Cohen, Bernard Parah, and Abubakar Nur Khalil to accelerate the process of moving African computer engineers into contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Last year, Qala was acquired by Btrust -- the charity founded by Jack Dorsey and Jay-Z to support Bitcoin infrastructure in Africa and the Global South -- and renamed Btrust Builders, where Femi now sits as director. He is focused on helping Africans move up the value chain in Bitcoin. Rather than just being consumers, like Africans are in so many ways in the existing global financial system, he wants them to be producers in the new Bitcoin economy.\n\nBtrust Builders director Femi Longe\nFemi says there are two legs to this journey: first, getting Africans more involved in protocol and infrastructure discussions. As Jack Dorsey says, if Bitcoin is going to be money for the world, it has to be made around the world. Femi says that African views will be needed to help evolve Bitcoin to its true potential. We can already see evidence of that in Machankura‚Äôs product road map, which could help decentralize and strengthen Bitcoin by creating potentially millions of more self-custodial users, and Gridless‚Äôs work, which makes mining more censorship-resistant and robust. The second leg to the journey, Femi says, is creating Bitcoin tools and applications that help Africans improve their quality of life, in the context of their own community, city, and country.Femi says that these are early days: in 2022, when Qala participated in a hackathon around the first Africa Bitcoin Conference, they struggled to attract participants. People were ‚Äújust dipping their feet in,‚Äù said Femi. But in 2023, he said the influx of talent was impressive. One winner was BitPension, a start-up aiming to allow anyone in Africa to set up a BTC-denominated pension, where anyone can buy satoshis in small amounts every day, which go into a time-locked self-custody, so that you can‚Äôt betray yourself. Today‚Äôs pensions, Femi says, could easily rug you, or they could be investing in oil or weapons companies. BitPension, or a similar idea, could be game-changing. The company won $5,000 of BTC, and is currently building a minimum viable product. Femi also pointed out Splice, another hackathon entrant, which is leveraging local communities of mobile money agents to facilitate dollar-stabilized trades over Lightning using Taproot Assets.Femi says that the Western mentality around Bitcoin is too focused on the savings aspect, and not enough on the medium of exchange part. In his view, this overemphasis on savings slows down the adoption, and cements fiat currency as the on-ramp to Bitcoin. A lot of the work that needs to be done is not just teaching people how to save, but also sitting down with local rideshare apps, for example, and showing them how they can add native Bitcoin payments. The only way we can get out of the broken currency system is to build a new one, he says, to leave the old one entirely behind.Consider the average person‚Äôs day, says Femi, and ask: what are all the touch points where they are going to interact with money? Now: how do we put Bitcoin at any one of them? How do we help create options for them to spend the Bitcoin that they earn? If they don‚Äôt have those options, Femi says, they remain part of the exploitative fiat system. The more merchant services we have, he believes, the more goods we can buy, and the less interest there will be in the conversion to USD aspect. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt get merchant traction,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwe are stuck in the past.‚ÄùAnother insight Femi has is that wallets will be in the future features, not core products. ‚ÄúWhere you keep your coins is important. More important is what you can do with them,‚Äù he says. There will be, he says, pension solutions, international trade settlement solutions, payroll solutions: currently, a lot of these services are disconnected from wallets, eventually those will be built in.\n\nBtrust Builders in Action\nSomething else Femi is focused on is helping Africans build strong narratives. He points to the fact that there are no Bitcoin books written by Africans. ‚ÄúWe need to tell our stories and document our experiences,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere is a strong narrative about what Bitcoin is for and who it is for,‚Äù he says. A lot of people who are using Bitcoin in their daily life beyond savings do not know how to, or aren‚Äôt very good at, explaining this to others. Or, they may not want to alert the authorities. For example, he points to Nigerian importers who don‚Äôt want the state to know they are paying in Bitcoin. The government, for its part, has instructed any bank to freeze accounts that are involved with Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.When people see Nigeria as a top-10 country for Bitcoin adoption, they say: there are so many hodlers in Nigeria. No, Femi says: ‚Äúa lot of these folks don‚Äôt even have a wallet. They just need to get funds to China tomorrow. They send naira to some guy who does the transfer.‚Äù Bitcoin is beginning to change the fabric of international commerce, but nobody knows. Partly it‚Äôs because people don‚Äôt want others to know about the details, but partly again it‚Äôs because there is no investment into a platform to help people tell their story.The Bitcoin ecosystem, he says, isn‚Äôt doing the work to counter what the IMF might be saying. There is very little empirical data on adoption, which according to Femi could really help with policymakers. One contact of his in the Nigerian government told him: ‚ÄúI need something to convince me that this makes sense, that it‚Äôs not just handing power from one group of white guys to another.‚Äù There isn‚Äôt enough work being done either, Femi says, to help people avoid scams and token schemes. This hurts the individual, and it hurts any governments looking to innovate. Look at the Central African Republic, he says. ‚ÄúThey tried to follow El Salvador, but a bunch of scammers with Sango Coin got to them first.‚Äù‚ÄúTo move forward, I think we need to write books,‚Äù Femi says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs scary for a lot of us because we haven‚Äôt done it before. We don‚Äôt know what the process is.‚Äù He says that 16 or 17 years ago he wanted to read a non-fiction book about Africa written by an African -- and it was very hard to find one. Africa Unchained by the Ghanaian economist George Ayittey was one of the first he saw, but there were not many others like it. This problem is now, according to Femi, spilling over into the Bitcoin space. What his fellow Btrust leader Abubakar Nur Khalil is doing with his Forbes columns is great, he says, ‚Äúbut we need books, and mentorship about how to get there.‚ÄùFemi thinks a lot could go wrong. He is wary of the power of Bitcoin billionaires as the currency continues to grow at scale. ‚ÄúAs an African,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúwe have seen that Bill Gates might have good intentions but his foundation has massive influence on healthcare policy on the continent at the moment. Zuck may be great - but again, his corporation has huge influence here. So there‚Äôs a part of me that‚Äôs afraid that even if the system is decentralizing, in a hyperbitcoinized world there will still be people with outsized power. The real promise of Bitcoin is that everyone should have a fair shot. The world we live in is broken: the gap between the richest and poorest, in every country, has never been wider. Replicating these same imbalances in the Bitcoin world would be a failure.‚ÄùDespite this concern, Femi says that Africans ‚Äúcannot afford to stay on the sidelines.‚Äù Bitcoin, he says, is inevitable and is already happening around us. He thinks it could change the existing global monetary system. ‚ÄúWhat happens in Africa,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúaffects the way black people are treated everywhere in the world. Bitcoin is an opportunity to redefine the power system and power structure.‚ÄùHis hope is that when Bitcoin achieves its full potential, Africa‚Äôs place in the world will be different. Independent, and not dependent. ‚ÄúI hate being from the continent that everyone just wants to help,‚Äù he says.But the only way Africa truly benefits from the Bitcoin revolution, he says, is if Africans lead the way. ‚ÄúThe hope I have,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúis not inevitable. We have to make it happen.‚ÄùVII. A Glitch In the MatrixIn Kenya, I got the chance to hear the origin story of Gridless from Philip: 10 years ago, he and Erik were discussing the Turkana Wind Farm, a huge 400-megawatt project built in Kenya that had no customers for years. The government had to pay 9 to 10 cents per KwH for nothing. This was because the architects wouldn‚Äôt build the site without a guaranteed income flow from a government or anchor client. The situation is common: a ‚Äútake or pay‚Äù contract. The worst part: Kenya has a lot of cheap geothermal power, but oftentimes it is actually kept offline because the government is already on the hook to pay for the expensive wind power.Erik and Philip watched this unfold and thought: what a disaster. They also thought: how could we address this? What‚Äôs a power user that doesn‚Äôt need a lot of connectivity? That‚Äôs location agnostic? Initially, they thought about bringing an aluminum processing plant up to Turkana, but the logistics challenges were overwhelming. Then they thought about a data center. Better, but the internet wouldn‚Äôt be good enough, they thought.Finally, the Eureka moment: Bitcoin could fix this. They laugh at how well they might have done if they had taken that risk a decade ago. Of course, it was early days back then, and mining at Turkana was an idea just a bit too crazy to leave their existing jobs for. It wasn‚Äôt until 2022 that they finally got everything in place to make Gridless happen.For many Africans, Bitcoin is a dual revolution: allowing communities to utilize stranded energy, and, at the same time, giving them access to a parallel global economy, based on property rights, not borrowing from abroad with strict conditions.In the modern financial system, countries like Kenya, Malawi, and the DRC must obtain dollars or euros to buy planes, industrial equipment, fertilizer, oil, or even to pay back debt. Bombardier is not going to accept kwacha for payment. And printing kwacha to buy dollars is not an option: it crashes the local currency. So policymakers must focus on making stuff that the US or Europe or China wants, instead of what the country needs. Only then can they earn the dollars to be able to advance as a nation.It doesn‚Äôt always have to be this way. If Bitcoin becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the global economy, African nations will be able to transform their energy into a global reserve currency, without asking permission from or doing business with any empire or far-away power. The relative amount of Bitcoin might not be huge, all things considered, but economics is all about the margins, where it could make a big difference.\n\nA resident outside of Bondo: today, no electricity, and a collapsing currency. Tomorrow: a customer of an efficient micro-grid, and a Bitcoin user?\nToday, Africa has 45 currencies. Inter-continental business is plagued by delays, bureaucracy, and rent-seeking, especially from abroad. As of late 2022, 80% of all inter-African payments were processed by a European or American company. But in a Bitcoin world, Africans could trade with each other without paying what is essentially a tribute tax to former colonial powers. There would be no global rent-seeking as someone in the DRC trades with someone in Kenya: it could be a truly peer-to-peer transaction.It‚Äôs hard to say, of course, if things will transpire in this way. But all revolutions start small and grow. Today, individuals in Eastern Africa can already easily connect with their peers elsewhere on the continent, in minutes or in seconds, in a way that does not unduly benefit the West.Fundamental technologies like the plow, metallurgy, the steam engine, airplane, and the internet have advanced civilization beyond the wildest dreams of our ancestors. People today without question live longer and healthier lives than we did 1,000 or 5,000 years ago. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs always been positive: advancement in one place has often come at the expense of advancement elsewhere. Colonialism, tyranny, slavery, the subjugation of women, and war remain scourges on the planet.One wonders what might come of a monetary revolution on par with the biggest inventions in human history. Morally speaking, it is hard to argue for today‚Äôs system, where approximately 1 billion people enjoy a globally-accepted, freely tradeable reserve currency, and 7 billion earn wages in strictly inferior monetary technologies. The dominant currency is rescued, at times, by tactics like aggressive interest rate hikes that crush more than 150 other weaker currencies, depleting the wages of billions of people. Politics and markets have both played a role in creating this currency caste system, and left alone, it seems it might only get more and more brutal, with peripheral currencies getting weaker and weaker, and dominant ones becoming more and more widespread. When the West suffers a financial collapse, ironically, people flock to the dollar.Where you are born should not determine the quality of your wages, and yet it does. Until now. Bitcoin is, without exaggeration, something like a glitch in The Matrix. Something the current system did not expect and cannot process. If it continues to grow and expand, it will eventually take away the ‚Äúcurrency devaluation‚Äù option that governments in Malawi and in so many other places exercise to keep their corrupt operations afloat.¬†They will have to resort to other options: higher taxes, or reduced government spending, but they will no longer be able to perpetrate mass theft at the press of a button.Three years ago, inspired initially by the 2020 Stone Ridge Shareholder Letter written by Ross Stevens, and confirmed by interviews with various Bitcoin miners, I wrote about how Bitcoin would help bring a lot of new renewable power online in Africa. But I had no idea at what scale, until I started to visit some of the Gridless sites, and I had time to think carefully about the implications, which are truly staggering.For example, instead of a government trying to build power infrastructure by reckless borrowing, selling off equity to foreigners, cutting fiscal expenditures, or raising taxes, why not just design a strategy around mining Bitcoin? Kenya could send a team of researchers to map all the sites like Lake Naivasha, figure out the total wasted electricity at existing power generation sites, figure out how many ASICs they could integrate, plot the income, and then take one last fiat loan from the IMF or an international creditor. As the years go by, the fiat payments to the IMF would get overshadowed by the appreciating capital from the Bitcoin mining operations. Eventually, they could go debt-free.One also can‚Äôt help but wonder about the fleets of older ASICs, no longer very profitable with expensive Western electricity rates, but perfectly functional with the cheap or free power being unlocked in Africa and the global south. They could, and likely will, be a boon for off-grid miners in countries like Malawi. Here‚Äôs another thing: weather events, trade wars, and financial crises might make energy very expensive in the West, where miners might have to shut down in America or Europe. But off-grid in Africa, this drama is irrelevant, and can even mean more Bitcoin for the local miners.It‚Äôs not just what Bitcoin can do for Africa: it‚Äôs what Africa can do for Bitcoin. If companies, and, one day soon, nation-states and corporations start converting the continent‚Äôs thousands of gigawatts of wasted and untapped hydro and geothermal and biomass energy into capital, feeding all of that electricity to the Bitcoin network, across a decentralized and disconnected grid system, then we have a much more unstoppable global currency. The kind of off-grid mining that makes economic sense to scale out across Africa can decentralize Bitcoin and make it stronger. Similarly, if the hundreds of millions of mobile money users of today never actually get a bank account, but just move from MPESA to Bitcoin using their SIM cards through a service like Machankura, the network becomes much more resilient.I asked Erik and Philip about the time it would take for Bitcoin to start to truly transform the continent. Erik said that within 30 years mining will help increase electricity access in Malawi from 15% to close to 100%. Philip said that Africa could, with Bitcoin‚Äôs help, reach Northern Europe‚Äôs per-capita electricity consumption by the end of the century. But both agreed, Bitcoin adoption as a medium of exchange might happen much, much faster.For hundreds of millions of people, it may not in the end be the United Nations or Bill and Melinda Gates or the World Bank that bring them into the 21st century, but an open-source software network, with no known inventor, and controlled by no company or government. For dozens of brilliant African entrepreneurs, this is the vision. And in a time where so many are jaded about the world around them, it‚Äôs a refreshing one.‚ÄúThe big problem that keeps us going every day,‚Äù says Erik, ‚Äúis the number of people who lack electricity on this continent. It‚Äôs impossible to comprehend.‚Äù‚ÄúPicture 1,000 people without power,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNow 10,000. Now 1 million. Now 600 million. You can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs so egregious and unfathomable. And without power, there is no freedom. But now we can fix this problem, and make money, all at the same time.‚Äù",

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Censorship Resistant?",
        "summary": "Economic incentives are what guarantee Bitcoin's censorship resistance, not ethical or moral honesty. This is how.",
        "content": "One of the central value propositions of Bitcoin is that no matter what happens, if you pay a high enough fee some miner out there in the world will confirm your transaction. In other words, Bitcoin is censorship resistant. There is a very good reason that the phrase ‚Äúcensorship resistant‚Äù is the wording you hear whenever this topic comes up, not ‚Äúcensorship proof.‚Äù Any individual miner can censor whatever they want, in the sense that they can refuse to include something in any block they mine themselves. They cannot, however, prevent other miners from including that transaction in their own blocks whenever they find one. Bitcoin is resistant to censorship, but it is not immune to it. Any miner can censor whatever they want, and that is free, ignoring of course the potential opportunity cost of revenue loss if there are not enough transactions available paying a comparable feerate to the transaction(s) they choose to censor. But this doesn‚Äôt stop the global system from processing that transaction anyway, unless those miners 1) comprise a majority of the entire network hashrate, 2) choose to leverage that reality to orphan the block of any miner who chooses to process the transaction(s) they wish to censor. To do this would lose the majority of miners engaging in the orphaning attack money as long as the minority set of miners continued mining blocks that included the ‚Äúverboten‚Äù transaction. Each time such a block was found, it would essentially increase the time until the next block that made it into the chain was found, lowering the majority of censoring miners‚Äô income on average. This would remain the case until the minority gave up and capitulated or was run out of business (as they would be forgoing revenue on any block including the censored transaction as well). For now, let‚Äôs assume that this scenario is not in the cards. If it were, Bitcoin is either a failure, or must exist in this state until non-censoring miners are able to quietly amass enough hashrate in order to overpower the current majority intent on orphaning blocks containing transactions they do not want confirmed in the blockchain. So what happens when a set of miners, in the minority, decide they are going to censor a specific subset of transactions from their blocks? The amount of blockspace that is available to those transactions shrinks. There is less blockspace available to them than every other class of transactions. What is the end result of this? Fee pressure for this class of transactions will hit saturation faster than every other class of transactions. \n\nJust for the sake of simplicity in the example, imagine it only takes 10 transactions to fill up any given block. We‚Äôll call regular transactions simply ‚Äúregular transactions‚Äù, and the transactions being censored ‚Äúverboten transactions.‚Äù Each day there are on average five blocks found, and there are five miners. The red blocks represent miners who will not mine verboten transactions, and the green blocks are miners who will. For regular transactions to saturate the available blockspace and start driving up fees, there needs to be 50+ transactions pending in order for the bidding frenzy to begin driving up fees and increasing the revenue for miners. At this point the fee generated revenue for all miners will begin increasing. For the verboten transactions, only 20+ transactions need to be pending in order for a bidding frenzy to begin amongst them, driving up fee revenues. But the fee revenue from the verboten transactions will only be collected by the green miners. In a situation where the verboten transactions are not saturating mempools in excess of the block capacity available to them, all miners will make the same rough level of income. Those verboten transactions must compete with regular transactions in order to have some guarantee of timely confirmation, so if regular transactions are saturating the mempool but verboten transactions are not the overall fee pressure will be relatively evenly distributed amongst all miners and no one will have any disproportionate fee revenue unavailable to the others. However, if verboten transactions are saturating the mempool in excess of the available blockspace, that fee pressure will drive up fees paid by verboten transactions only for the green miners. Having elected to censor these transactions, red miners will not be realizing any increased fee revenue from the verboten transactions. Regular transactions in this scenario will not have to compete with verboten transactions in feerates unless they need to confirm in the next block, so the indirect feerate rise in regular transactions because of verboten transactions‚Äô fee pressure will not lead to an equivalent increase in revenue for red miners. This disequilibrium leaves green miners earning more revenue per block/hash than red miners. This is, incentivize wise, obviously unsustainable. One of two things will happen over time: 1) either the green miners will reinvest the extra revenue they are acquiring and expand their percentage of the hashrate, or 2) miners will defect from the red side and the green set of miners will grow in percentage of the hashrate that way. \n\nThis dynamic of higher fees for green miners will result in the growth of the hashrate of green miners, regardless of whether through reinvestment or defection from red miners, until it reaches an equilibrium where the verboten transactions‚Äô blockspace demand levels off with regular transactions, and both groups of miners are making roughly the same income. This equilibrium will last until the verboten transactions‚Äô demand for blockspace exceeds that available to them, and then the entire dance of green miners earning more until they grow in network hashrate share to an equilibrium point of equal fee revenue again.This dynamic is why Bitcoin is censorship resistant. Not because all miners are not capable of censoring something, but because miners are incentivized to include something other miners are censoring through market dynamics. If some miners censor a class of transactions, they decrease the amount of blockspace available to them and drive up the fees they are willing to pay. Pure and simple. Unless miners are completely irrational, in which case Bitcoin‚Äôs entire security model is called into question, some will include these transactions and earn the extra revenue.¬†",

The pioneer behind this academic milestone is Ella Hough, a student at Cornell University, who is set to embark on a unique academic journey that is centered around Bitcoin.‚ÄúThe past 15 months have been a long but incredibly worthwhile road to¬†approval,‚Äù Hough told Bitcoin Magazine. ‚ÄúI continue to believe that spending my time and energy studying Bitcoin is the most worthwhile academic endeavor. I‚Äôm particularly grateful to study it inside the College of Arts and Sciences and at Cornell whose founders championed ideals Bitcoin embodies, warning of the dangers of fiat money inflation and supporting the development of rails to transfer knowledge-based and monetary wealth.‚ÄùElla's¬†Robert S. Harrison College Scholar¬†major will encompass a diverse range of subjects, including Cognitive Science, Psychology, Philosophy, Information Science, Government, Economics, Anthropology, and History. This interdisciplinary approach reflects the multifaceted nature of Bitcoin, exploring its cognitive and game theoretical components, as well as its implications for adoption and societal structures.‚ÄúWhen asked, ‚ÄòWhat is my College Scholar major?‚Äô My response would be Bitcoin,‚Äù she further explained. ‚ÄúThe cognitive and game theoretical components related to Bitcoin adoption and the implications of Bitcoin to emphasize why it matters.‚ÄùAs part of the Robert S. Harrison College Scholar Program¬†requirements, Ella will undertake the task of writing and presenting an honors thesis with an oral defense in May, 2025. While her thesis is set to adapt and evolve in accordance to new information over time, Ella anticipates the core focus of her thesis will center around the world-wide adoption and revolutionary implications of Bitcoin the network and asset. Her final thesis will be displayed at the university in Klarman Hall and will be kept in the permanent library of the program, she told Bitcoin Magazine.One distinctive feature of Ella's new academic journey is her ability to choose the title that will appear on her transcript. Pending approval from the Director of the Program, Bitcoin will prominently feature in her official credentials, symbolizing her dedication to exploring the significance of this decentralized technology.Ella's commitment to studying Bitcoin further extends beyond academia; she has taken the initiative to establish Cornell's first official Bitcoin club. The club will join Generation Bitcoin's Bitcoin Students Network‚Äîa Gen Z focused community built to support and inspire college and high school aged students to get involved in Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThere is a humanitarian imperative affecting generations, present and future, to study all aspects of Bitcoin and for students to be validated in their efforts,‚Äù Hough¬†stated. ‚ÄúMy hope is that this precedent encourages, empowers, and eases the journey for other students to think outside our current systems and build a more inclusive, truthful, and honest world.‚ÄùAs Bitcoin continues to shape the global financial landscape, Ella's pioneering effort to further her understanding of Bitcoin at a prestigious university opens doors for further¬†exploration and understanding of this burgeoning technology.",

        "summary": "Regulation is not a necessary prerequisite for a population to see the value in Bitcoin.",
        "content": "Pakistan is one of the emerging markets in Southeast Asia with a population of approximately 250 million, and a country where the majority of the population lives below the poverty line. The people of Pakistan are hopeful; many believe that good times are coming, and the country's future is bright amid political chaos and a tumbling financial situation for 2023. However, the overall situation seems to be getting on track, with the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) reaching its historical all-time highs. \"Bitcoin Pakistan,\" a community of like-minded technology and bitcoin enthusiasts in Pakistan, organized its first physical networking event in Lahore last month, in November. The interest in understanding bitcoin as an inflation hedge tool and a global payments network is increasing. However, people in Pakistan are also afraid of the legality of cryptocurrency; many seem reluctant to talk publicly about it, fearing consequences from the authorities. There is a common misunderstanding that bitcoin is banned or illegal in Pakistan. The Central Bank of Nigeria imposed a similar ban on cryptocurrency transactions through banks in 2021. However, after witnessing the increased demand for bitcoin and its usage in the country, the CBN lifted the ban in the latest circular, providing clear instructions. The Central Bank of Nigeria stated: \"However, current trends globally have shown that there is a need to regulate the activities of virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which include cryptocurrencies and crypto assets.\" In contrast, the State Bank of Pakistan, through its Circular issued in 2018, cautioned the public that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, issued, or guaranteed by the Government of Pakistan. Moreover, the SBP clarified that it does not authorize or license any individual or entity for the issuance, sale, purchase, exchange, or investment in any such Virtual Currencies (VCs)/ Coins/ Tokens in Pakistan. Therefore, all regulated entities were advised to refrain from processing, using, trading, holding, transferring value, promoting, and investing in Virtual Currencies/ Tokens. Bitcoin adoption, on the other hand, has increased significantly in Pakistan, even though there is no regulated exchange in the region. People use peer-to-peer services like Binance, Paxful, and other OTC trade methods to acquire bitcoin in Pakistan. The number may not be precise, but it seems Pakistan is ranking among the top countries in bitcoin adoption rate in emerging markets in the developing world.Pakistan's rapid adoption of bitcoin can also be explained when we look at the yearly inflation, which is exceeding 25% and has been worsening for the past few years amid political chaos and pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The freelancing industry is thriving, and Pakistan is one of the top countries exporting IT services. The freelancers' community has shifted towards storing a major portion of their wealth in foreign currency such as USD or GBP, and the number of freelancers holding bitcoin or USDT as an inflation hedge has increased significantly since the COVID crisis. Bitcoin is a revolution that can't be stopped; many other nations have realized it and are working to make regulations to keep up with the innovation in the digital world. With friendly regulations from the government and a strict crackdown on crypto frauds in Pakistan, doors can open for new opportunities and attract huge investments that can help lift Pakistan out of its debt crisis.This is a guest post by Farooq Ahmed.

        "summary": "Bitcoin was designed to be a system without middlemen, but unless we stop pretending it is perfect as is and work to improve it, middlemen will be the only way to interact with it for most people.",
        "content": "What started as a single transaction from Satoshi to Hal Finney, has evolved into a complex system of industrial scale miners, evolving meta-protocols like the Lightning Network and Fedimint, and a full embrace of institutional investors with the record breaking inflows into various newly approved spot ETFs. Bitcoin has come a dramatically long way, and with that comes a somewhat earned sense of optimism for those who have invested their time, money, and enthusiasm. Unfortunately this optimism, and sense of ‚Äúinevitability‚Äù I have previously written on, has contributed to a culture of complacency. This is hallmarked by a narrative that early Bitcoin protocol ossification is acceptable or even desirable, itself underscored by the implicit assumption that the largest risks to Bitcoin now are potential changes and Trojan horses to the protocol. This belief is categorically false. The greatest danger to Bitcoin is the certain future it has if it were in fact to effectively ‚Äúossify‚Äù today: Certain regulatory capture, an uncapped fractional reserve supply, and censored and monitored transactions. Old NewsIf that sounds extreme, then you haven‚Äôt been paying attention. The problems facing Bitcoin that lead to this inevitable result aren‚Äôt remotely new. In fact it was touched on by Hal Finney himself 14 years ago:‚ÄúActually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain‚Ä¶ Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems‚Ä¶Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as‚Ä¶ well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.‚ÄùFrom the very beginning, many of Bitcoin‚Äôs earliest adopters clearly understood its limitations and the resulting downstream implications. What has changed since then? Not the math. Even with the Lightning Network, an innovation that Hal Finney would not be around to see, the upper limit for the number of regular users Bitcoin can onboard in its current state is optimistically 100 million. That number does not factor in usability/user experience whatsoever, which is an inherent challenge of the Lightning Network due to the very novel way in which it works compared to any other financial system. In the Lightning Network whitepaper itself, authors Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja make it clear that alone it is not any kind of silver bullet enabling global scale: ‚ÄúIf all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year)‚ÄùThe resulting cap on users who can leverage Bitcoin today in a self sovereign way without the use of a trusted 3rd party presents an obvious problem. Especially if we assume adoption and usage will continue to grow. Saifdean Ammous authored ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Standard‚Äù, a book which received much fanfare for making the compelling economic case for Bitcoin as the ultimate manifestation of ‚Äúhard money‚Äù. A Bitcoin standard, he argues, will out-compete the current fiat money system by virtue of its hard supply. Similarly, in 2014 Pierre Rochard popularized the idea of the ‚Äúspeculative attack‚Äù, arguing that the adoption of the bitcoin monetary unit would happen first gradually, then extremely rapidly. In our projection of the future, we will assume both lines of thinking are correct, and that demand for bitcoin the monetary unit will attract an increasing amount of savings as its network effects only further accelerate its own widespread global adoption. This ‚Äúhyperbitcoinization‚Äù scenario however presents an impossible challenge for the current constraints of both the Bitcoin core protocol and Lightning Network. What will it mean then when hundreds of millions, and then billions, flee into the confidence of Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply as the mainstream Bitcoin community believes they will? Very simply, if they can‚Äôt afford to use the core protocol or even the Lightning Network (no need to even discuss ease of use or UX here, that‚Äôs a separate sizable challenge) due to hard scalability limits, they will be forced to use centralized and custodial providers. Even if they don‚Äôt want to. There‚Äôs no beating around this bush or wishing it away.If you accept the premise of bitcoin as a superior money, and also understand the practical limitations of the protocol today, then this is the certain outcome Bitcoin is currently on track to reach. Gold Standard 2.0 It‚Äôs a fair question to ask why this might pose a problem at all. Hal Finney certainly didn‚Äôt seem to imply so in his own aforementioned post. Returning to the Bitcoin Standard, Ammous dedicates a significant amount of the book‚Äôs opening chapters to discussing the history of the gold standard, its strengths, and most importantly its weaknesses. Crucially he identifies the Achilles heel: Gold was simply too expensive to secure and difficult to transact with in meaningful quantities. As a result, paper money technology first came to be used as convenient IOUs for gold, which itself was stored in centralized locations specialized to the task of guarding and transferring large amounts of gold as needed. Over time as technology improved and commerce became more global, these centralized custodians only continued to grow, until they were all eventually captured by States through regulatory power and later outright fiat, which completely severed the new fiat money from the underlying gold backing. In projecting the future for Bitcoin in its current state, we can see a very similar outcome unfolding. There might not be a cost issue with the storage of bitcoin using private keys and mnemonic phrases, but in our hyperbitcoinization scenario the ability to transact with self custodied bitcoin quickly evaporates for all but the institutions and the super wealthy who can afford the fees, even when using Lightning. The consequences are much the same as they were under a gold standard. Platforms like Coinbase or Cashapp will take center stage, given transactions within their custodial platforms have zero marginal cost as they are just tracked in a central database. Cross platform payments can also be aggregated between these platforms with Lightning channels or on-chain payments extremely cost effectively. The result is a landscape that is not all too dissimilar from the state of the gold standard in the early 20th century, with most supply held by large custodial institutions which States could trivially influence, coerce, and capture. To return to the question of the biggest threat to Bitcoin: In this future, there‚Äôs zero necessity in attacking the base layer if the only ones that can actually use it are large known entities with everything to lose. To be sure, substantial differences from the original gold standard would in fact exist. Transactions being natively digital, proof of reserves being possible, and the supply being completely transparent are notable improvements over the gold standard. Still, none of these differences impact our self custody conundrum in any way. As far as the vision of Bitcoin being a censorship resistant money, once the vast majority is held by trusted third parties, there is nothing stopping States from strictly enforcing transaction monitoring, asset seizures, and capital controls. There is also nothing stopping them from enabling and even encouraging fractional reserve policies in the interest of prudent economic management. Crucially, in the event of these actions, the vast majority of users would have no ability to opt out by withdrawing funds to their own custody.It‚Äôs not all bad. In this scenario, bitcoin the monetary unit still appreciates by leaps and bounds. Everyone who‚Äôs humored me this far with their attention will still likely stand to financially benefit immensely in this future. But is that it? Is the vision of Bitcoin as a foundational tool for censorship resistance, and separating money and State, dead? If we continue to deny, or worse encourage, the current trajectory, then there‚Äôs zero doubt that it is. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Misplaced FearFortunately, there‚Äôs no reason or prevailing argument for the Bitcoin network to have already ossified. It remains firmly within the grasp of the core community to continue to push forward research, debate, and proposals for further improving the base protocol to increase the scale and usability of solutions like the Lightning Network, as well as enable whole new potential constructs such as the Ark protocol, advanced statechains, and more. It‚Äôs important however, to acknowledge how we‚Äôve reached such a point that ‚Äúossification‚Äù became a significant prescriptive narrative, rather than a purely descriptive idea of the eventual end state of a widely adopted Bitcoin protocol. Such a prescription is necessarily rooted in the assumption that Bitcoin‚Äôs largest attack vector comes from future code changes. This line of thinking isn‚Äôt baseless. It is true that protocol changes can be an attack vector. After all, we‚Äôve actually seen that very attack play out before with Segwit2X when a consortium of large Bitcoin institutions and miners coordinated a unilateral hard fork to the Bitcoin protocol to increase the base block size in 2017. However we must also acknowledge that Segwit2x failed in a miserable fashion. Worse still, the futility of the attack was obvious before its eventual collapse as it entirely misjudged the dynamics involved in introducing changes to a distributed peer to peer protocol.The participation of many of the individuals and companies involved with Segwit2X suffered lasting reputational damage in many cases, making it not only a failed effort, but a costly one. For any enterprising attacker looking to compromise Bitcoin for good, it would be abundantly clear that attempting to repeat this approach or any variation of it is a fool's errand. A much easier and cheaper approach with a much higher likelihood of success, would be to invest in slowing the already challenging work of building consensus to introduce beneficial extensions to the Bitcoin protocol, ensuring that the experiment in both sound and censorship resistant money is ultimately a victim of its own success. Whether or not you believe this is actively happening today, the actions that need to be taken are identical. So What NowUltimately, where we are now and what we must do is not so different from the time Hal made his observation in 2009: We must continue critically examining the limitations of the Bitcoin protocol and ecosystem, and push forward as a community to address these shortcomings. Thankfully a number of research advancements and proposals have been made for further increasing scalability that don‚Äôt require larger block sizes. Bitcoin core contributor James O‚ÄôBeirne released a blog post last year with a sober technical analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs immediate scalability prospects and gives good context to some of these proposals, and more recently Mutiny wallet developer Ben Carman has taken a critical look at the issues surrounding the Lightning Network more specifically. There has never ceased to be a strong signal amidst all the noise, and the best we can do is put in the individual work to identify and amplify it, while actively pushing back against counter productive narratives that do not contribute to meaningfully improving Bitcoin. By doing that, perhaps we can find a way to scale the vision of truly peer to peer and sovereign money to every single person on the planet. We may very well still fall short, and there‚Äôs absolutely no guarantees. But it‚Äôs worth a shot.¬†This is a guest post by Ariel Deschapell.

        "summary": "The third part in an article series by Ivan Makedonski from Breez on how Lightning's instant settlement finality can be a disruptive force fundamentally changing how different industries are organized.",
        "content": "The challenges associated with physical work and delayed payments, as discussed in the construction and logistics industries articles, might not be as directly applicable to industries with less physical movement. However, the principles of instant settlement and the removal of intermediaries can still bring efficiency and innovation to various sectors. The advantages of instant settlement, such as reduced transaction fees, faster payment processing, and increased transparency, can positively impact industries beyond the physical realm. Whether it's in the realm of digital services, intellectual property, or other sectors that are already dematerialized, the application of instant settlement principles can streamline transactions and enhance overall efficiency.Navigating The Written OdysseyEntering the realm of book publishing, especially for a debut author, is a journey filled with challenges. The primary hurdle involves persuading a publishing house to forge a deal, a daunting task for those yet to establish their reputation in the market. The negotiation landscape is complicated by endless uncertainties, making it difficult to strike a mutually beneficial deal. Even if you try to be fair for both sides it is hard. Most people will prioritize themselves and what they get in an uncertain environment - like figuring out how many books will be sold for a first time author. The dynamics intensify when publishing houses provide editors to authors--an arrangement that frequently sparks friction. Authors, protective of their creative work, may resist alterations, but editors, with seasoned expertise, have to navigate the delicate balance between preserving the author's vision and refining the content.The complexities extend to the business side, with potential pitfalls surrounding signing bonuses. Questions linger: What if the bonus overshoots and the book underperforms? What if the book succeeds, but the bonus proves inadequate, leading the author to seek alternatives for subsequent works? Marketing poses another challenge, raising dilemmas about investments, audiobook adaptations, navigating royalty payments, and banking fees for small markets and international payments.Just like in the logistics industry here with royalties, we have the same problem of counterparty risk. In addition to stopping the payments to the authors completely, do you trust the publishers that they are giving the correct sales numbers? Translation decisions add another layer, raising queries about language choices, and fair compensation for translators. What about the illustrators? Each party involved creates more and more friction in the system just because everyone is seeking fair compensation. The payment system does not allow them to focus on what they provide in terms of value, but focuses everyone on mitigating the shortcomings of it. Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires not only innovation but also transparent and adaptive contractual frameworks to foster a more equitable and efficient publishing ecosystem.The challenges for authors extend beyond the realm of creative content, and the intricacies of the publishing and marketing landscape. While the invention of ebooks has somewhat dismantled barriers, enabling easier self-publishing, the journey is not without hurdles. Authors opting for self-publishing must navigate the complexities of setting up accounts and managing distribution before reaching the point of uploading their work. Once published, the dual role of author and marketer emerges, demanding not only literary prowess but also strategic promotional efforts to capture the audience's attention and drive sales. The demanding nature of marketing leaves authors with limited time for their core competency - writing - which hinders the development of subsequent books that they would like to write.Lighting Up Publishing: From Solo Authors to Collaborative Ventures, Unleashing the Potential of Instant Split PaymentsNow that this is the third industry that we are looking into, we know that delayed payments are the problem and that they are tied to time and not actual work - ‚ÄúYou have to write the book till this date or else‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will gather all payments and royalties will be paid later‚Äù. Since we know now that the Lightning Network can fix this let‚Äôs dig into the solution and what it may look like.If you're a first-time author and choose to publish your book on your self-made app, you can instantly receive 100% of the income for each purchase. By utilizing a non-custodial solution like Breez, where no one holds money for others, you avoid the complexities associated with traditional payment methods. This setup eliminates the need for currency exchanges, providing a seamless global payment network directly connected to your app. The benefits go beyond mere currency considerations, freeing buyers from the hassle of exchange rate fees and relieving them of the complexities associated with navigating diverse regulations and processes across various countries. Who knows what regulations you have to deal with to be able to operate with the Iranian Rial just to sell a simple book? With a non-custodial solution on the Lightning Network, you get to avoid all that.That is a big benefit for one-man shows in the book industry, but let‚Äôs take it a step further. In this scenario, where the relationship involves only the author and a publisher, the process becomes streamlined without the need for intricate negotiations, personal data sharing, or complex contracts with various clauses. With the instant settlement, there's no need for advance payments, both the author and publisher receive a percentage from each sale instantly when the purchase is made. The publisher, responsible for uploading and promoting the book on their website, and the author are now aligned in the common goal of selling more books. The only task left is to determine the fair percentage splits between the author and the publisher, fostering a collaborative and efficient partnership. Now the word royalties will have a completely new meaning.Okay, that is between two entities, but we are not going to stop there. Now that the book is published the book can be translated to other languages. In that case, the complexity does not increase a lot. They just have to determine the percentage share split between the publisher, author, and translator for each sale of the translated version. Upon purchase of the translated book, each payment will be split three ways. Meanwhile, the original language version undergoes a two-way split, with the translator excluded from this split since they didn't contribute to that version. This ensures that the relevant individuals receive sats exclusively for their specific contributions. There might be a need for a separate publisher for the translated language, leading to a split between the author, translator, and second publisher. For the original language, the split occurs between the author and the first publisher. Theoretically, the current system goes through a similar structure for the payments, but I am reminding you here that only the instant split settlement makes that plan match the reality in practice. The moment that any entity starts holding funds for someone else even for a little, then the problems go up exponentially. This is why Breez is committed to preserving the peer-to-peer nature of Bitcoin in lightning payments.Instant Splits For Narrators, Producers, And All Contributors - A Symphony Of Fair CompensationWe are not done yet with the benefits. Now that we have a path for each language, what will it look like for audiobooks? In that case, you just add one more split based on the agreement between the parties. If you create an audiobook in the original language then the split will be between Author, Publisher, and Audiobook creator. The creation of an audiobook is a project on its own of casting, recording, post-production, and distribution. That has multiple people involved so the split for the audiobook payment in reality may look like this:Author, Publisher, Producer, Recording engineer, Narrator, Editing/mastering engineer.In this dynamic model, contributors may wear multiple \"hats\" within a project, allowing them to assume various roles and, consequently, earn a share for each responsibility they undertake. For instance, an Author might take on the roles of both Producer and Narrator, performing additional work beyond their original scope. In such cases, the Author receives a percentage for each distinct role. However, should the Author choose not to take on these additional roles, someone else can assume those responsibilities and reap the corresponding benefits. This structure ensures alignment, with compensation tied directly to individual contributions at the time of each book sale, eliminating compensation for time or speculation based on future sales.Unlike the other two industries we explored in construction here and logistics here, the timing of payment in the publishing industry differs. In the preceding sectors, individuals receive compensation instantly upon completing their respective tasks. However, in the realm of authors, payment is not immediate for the act of writing; it occurs when someone is willing to pay the price for the published work. This distinction highlights a fundamental principle: everyone is remunerated when they deliver value to someone else who is willing to pay. Whether delivering a package to the correct address or constructing a house for someone else to inhabit, optimizing the process with the client in mind becomes paramount. Therefore, receiving sats is contingent on providing intrinsic value to others, aligning the industry with similar principles observed in construction and logistics. If you build or deliver something that people do not want, that means you did not provide value.Instant Influence: From Metrics To Value - A Paradigm Shift In Compensation For PromotionsNow let‚Äôs take it even a step further. This will not be the only industry where the influencers can change their business model, but I will use it as an example to explain the change that they will experience in their service. Currently, the influencers get paid for views or mentions depending on whether the medium is audio or video. Their value, as perceived by those paying them, hinges on metrics such as subscriber counts, views, and downloads. But for the person that is paying, is it going to matter if the influencer talks about a book but then it does not result in sales of the book? Or again what happens if someone mentions it but the sales are extraordinary, then the influencer has to receive a more fair compensation. Connecting payments directly to actual value, rather than relying on derivative indicators, ensures influencers receive fair compensation in line with their impact on sales.Well, the instant settlement fixes that. Authors can now decide on a fixed percentage for influencers per sale, allowing anyone to become an influencer without the need for a massive following. Even a small blog with a modest readership of less than fifty people can result in direct, instant compensation for sales generated. This eliminates barriers to entry for the influencers to have a following and aligns incentives for authors seeking broader promotion. There is a massive friction in the influencer market currently because with poor measuring tools you do not want the money to be wasted on promotion that does not work. This future system is not going to waste a single sat for promotion because it is not paying for a promotion. You are negotiating a commission on every sale which the actual buyer pays - increasing sales is the intent of the authors reaching out to influencers anyway.Now that we have an influencer promoting a book the UX (user experience) is going to be completely different. Right now to promote anything as an influencer you receive a code that you have to ask for, from the publisher in this case. Then your viewers/listeners have to go to the website and fill in all the information about themselves. Then they have to enter their card information which has to be secured from the website somehow. Then they enter the promo code and receive the ebook that they wanted. On the other side, the publisher has to hope he does not get a chargeback for whatever reason in the next 30 days. The instant settlement UX will be: - Influencers enter a lightning address where they want to receive their commissions from for every sale. - Then they display a link or a QR code that will be a lightning invoice for the specific book. - The buyer enters an email where they want the ebook to be sent.The instant split payment is sent and everyone including the influencer receives their share of it. This way even influencers might realize that the likes, views and comments are not the most important thing and focus on providing real value for their viewers. This not only streamlines the process but may also alleviate the impact of negative comments and dislikes for influencers. Because their income is not tied to the likes that means it will no longer be the most important thing. They will focus on promoting quality products that sell a lot so they get a piece of those sales and the likes will be secondary.The transformation in influencer behavior triggered by instant settlement not only disrupts their traditional approaches but sparks competition among publishers and influencers alike. Authors may opt for a model where they focus solely on writing, leveraging influencers to handle promotion without dealing with traditional editors. This introduces a more diverse competitive landscape, where publishing houses will compete with content creators from different industries who passionately recommend authors they love. While these changes benefit readers, authors, and participants, those resistant to competition may be the only ones disliking this evolving landscape.\n\nIndeed, envisioning the transformative power of instant payments, there's an opportunity for an innovator to replicate what Amazon did to bookstores. By adopting a model built on advanced technology and leveraging the advantages of instant settlements, this individual can start with books and subsequently explore avenues for expansion. The potential for such a disruptive force lies not only in reshaping the publishing landscape but also in inspiring new possibilities across diverse industries.Now let‚Äôs go and publish that app.This is a guest post by Ivan Makedonski.

        "summary": "Linus Torvald's philosophy of Linux kernel development is governed by one core principle, \"Don't break userspace.\" How does this philosophy map to development of the Bitcoin protocol?",
        "content": "‚ÄúMauro, SHUT THE FUCK UP!It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance?If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to Understand?‚Äù -Linus TorvaldsDon‚Äôt break userspace. This is Linus Torvald‚Äôs golden rule for development of the Linux kernel. For those of you reading this who are not familiar with the nature of Linux, or operating systems in general, the kernel is the heart and soul of an operating system. The kernel is what actually manages the hardware, moving bits around between storage and RAM, between the RAM and the CPU as things are computed, and all of the little devices and pieces of the actual computer that need to be controlled at the hardware level. Every application or program written for an operating system has to interact with the kernel. When you download Photoshop, or Telegram, everything that program is doing boils down to essentially calling the kernel. ‚ÄúHey kernel, take what I just typed and process it and send it over a network connection to the server.‚Äù ‚ÄúHey kernel, take the color shift I made to this pitch, take it out of RAM and send it to the CPU to modify it, then put it back in RAM.‚Äù When the kernel is changed, in a somewhat similar fashion to Bitcoin, the chief goal of developers is to ensure that existing applications that assume a specific way to interact with the kernel do not break because of a change to the kernel. Sounds very familiar to Bitcoin and the necessity to maintain backwards compatibility for network consensus upgrades doesn‚Äôt it? ‚ÄúSeriously. How hard is this rule to understand? We particularly don't break user space with TOTAL CRAP. I'm angry, because your whole email was so _horribly_ wrong, and the patch that broke things was so obviously crap. The whole patch is incredibly broken shit. It adds an insane error code (ENOENT), and then because it's so insane, it adds a few places to fix it up (\"ret == -ENOENT ? -EINVAL : ret\").The fact that you then try to make *excuses* for breaking user space, and blaming some external program that *used* to work, is just shameful. It's not how we work.Fix your f*cking \"compliance tool\", because it is obviously broken. And fix your approach to kernel programming.‚Äù -Linus TorvaldsLinux is one of the most important, if not the most important, open source project in the entire world. Android runs on Linux, half of the backend infrastructure (if not way more) runs on Linux. Embedded systems controlling all kinds of computerized things in the background of your life you wouldn‚Äôt even consider run on Linux. The world literally runs on Linux. It might not have taken over the desktop as many autistic Linux users wanted to see happen, but it quietly ate almost everything else in the background without anyone noticing. All of these applications and programs people use in the course of their daily lives depend on the assumption that Linux kernel developers will not break backwards compatibility in new versions of the kernel to allow their applications to continue functioning. Otherwise, anything running applications must continue using older versions of the kernel or take on the burden of altering their applications to interact with a breaking change in the kernel. Bitcoin‚Äôs most likely path to success is a very similar road, simply becoming a platform that financial applications and tools are built on top of in such a way that most people using them won‚Äôt even realize or consider that ‚ÄúBitcoin ate the world.‚Äù In a similar vein to Linux, that golden rule of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break userspace‚Äù applies tenfold. The problem is the nature of Bitcoin as a distributed consensus system, rather than a single local kernel running on one person‚Äôs machine, wildly changes what ‚Äúbreaking userspace‚Äù means. It‚Äôs not just developers that can break userspace, users themselves can break userspace. The entire last year of Ordinals, Inscriptions, and BRC-20 tokens should definitively demonstrate that. This offers a very serious quandary when looking at the mantra of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt break userspace‚Äù from the point of view of developers. As much as many Bitcoiners in this space do not like Ordinals, and are upset that their own use cases are being disrupted by the network traffic Ordinals users are creating, both groups are users. So how do developers confront this problem? One group of users is breaking userspace for another group of users. To enact a change that prevents the use of Ordinals or Inscriptions explicitly violates the mandates of don‚Äôt break userspace. I‚Äôm sure people want to say ‚ÄúTaproot broke userspace!‚Äù in response to this dilemma, but it did not. Taproot activation, and the allowance for witness data to be as large as the entire blocksize, did not break any pre-existing applications or uses built on top of Bitcoin. All it did was open the door for new applications and use cases. So what do we do here? To try and filter, or break by a consensus change, people making Inscriptions or trading Ordinals is to fundamentally violate the maxim of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt break userspace.‚Äù To do nothing allows one class of users to break the userspace of another class of users. There is fundamentally no solution to this problem except to violate the golden rule, or to implement functionality that allows the class of users‚Äô whose userspace is broken now to adapt to the new realities of the network and maintain a viable version of their applications and use cases. Not breaking the userspace of Bitcoin is of critical importance for its continued success and functionality, but it is not as simple as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù Dynamic changes in user behavior, that require no change to the actual protocol itself, can have the same effect at the end of the day as a breaking change to the protocol. Are developers supposed to pick and choose which applications‚Äô userspace is broken to maintain that of another application? I would say no, and go further to say that anyone advocating for such behavior from developers is demanding them to act irresponsibly and in a way that harms users of the system. So what is the answer here? There is no answer except to push forward and continue adding improvements to the protocol that allow applications being broken by the behavior of certain users to function in the presence of emergent changes in users‚Äô behavior. Otherwise, you are asking developers to throw out the golden rule and effectively play kingmakers in regards to what use cases are viable to build on top of Bitcoin.If we go down that road, then what are we actually doing here? I can‚Äôt tell you what we‚Äôre doing at that point, but I can tell you it‚Äôs not building a distributed and neutral system anymore.",

        "summary": "When looking at the raw numbers, when will inscriptions start to become economically non-viable and begin being priced out by regular financial transactions?",
        "content": "The battle for the future of Bitcoin is raging in real time on twitter as we are on the cusp of global economic contraction, thanks to 50+ years of the USD fiat regime, and are eagerly waiting for the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC. Yet, in the trenches on Twitter, the skirmish being fought is over what bitcoin is and how it should and shouldn‚Äôt be used. I covered this battle in some detail on Orange Label, but to summarize there are two camps in this battle: Monetary Maximalists & Blockspace Demand Maximalist. The big question is should inscriptions be a part of Bitcoin and how can they be stopped?The purpose of this piece is not to sway you one way or another, but rather share some numbers that make the case that inscriptions will be priced out over time. Over the past year, we saw a doubling of BTC price and hashrate and during that time inscriptions caused some big changes in blockspace demand. We saw fees rise to a 4 year high as mempools were purging reasonable fees1, which means there were so many high fee transactions in mempools that lower fee transactions were being dropped from mempools. In other words, there was no chance for low fee transactions to be included in blocks. What started as a laughable novelty 12 months ago has brought in legions of new bitcoiners. This is an undeniable fact when you look up the number of reachable nodes on the network over the past couple years.As bitcoin twitter has begun to divide on the topic, a meme has emerged suggesting that inscriptions will be priced out as NGU technology does its thing. This leads to the next logical question‚Ä¶ at what point do inscriptions get priced out? That‚Äôs for the market to decide. For now, we can simply run the numbers and see how many dollars an inscription will cost as Bitcoin price appreciates.The CalculatorI am a big fan of table calculators23 and use them quite often when creating a story. For this piece I wanted to understand how much it would cost to inscribe a 100kb photograph at various prices. That then turned into asking how much these BRC20 shitcoiners are spending, and when will that nonsense end. These are around 50bytes or 0.05 kb in size for reference. I was able to track down4 a simplified formula for making an inscription:Ordinal Inscription Cost Calculator FormulaTotal USD Cost = ((((Inscription size in kb * 1000) / 4 * Fee Rate)) / 100,000,000 ) * Current BTCUSD PriceThe important variables for this calculation is the file size in kilobytes, the fee rate in sats/vbyte, and the current BTCUSD price. With this little bit of information I was able to make a simple static table to see how different sized inscriptions will increase in USD cost as NGU for fees and BTCUSD.\n\nThis chart reveals much information and the big takeaway for me is just how expensive it will be to put data in blocks in the not too distant future. Let‚Äôs take our 100kb image example. At current fees around 100 sat/vbyte and $50,000 BTCUSD that will cost $1,250 to inscribe. That is a big pill to swallow. Now let‚Äôs examine the shitcoin token BRC20 that‚Äôs used for money laundering‚Ä¶ It is around 0.05kb in size. ‚ÄòAt current fees around 100 sat/vbyte and $50,000 BTCUSD that will cost $0.63 to inscribe. That is a small amount, but these things are being inscribed by the truckload. We are talking collections with 1m units. So not a small amount and there is not a single BRC20, there are tons popping up. The question about the liquidity for these things is for a different post.As you move down the chart to higher BTCUSD prices for each inscription size, you can see just how ridiculous things become. Our humble 100kb jpg will cost $62,500 to inscribe when BTCUSD hits $1m and 200 sat/vbyte. Similarly the same BRC20 would increase to $25 for a single token. These kind of prices start to price out the really dumb like monkey pictures and memecoin shitcoins. As you can see, these inscriptions production cost increases linearly with BTCUSD increases. This alone will price out large portions of the market, however you must ask yourself as the overall market size increases, that will bring new entrants who will drive additional demand, in other words the pond will get bigger and the fish will get bigger, the small fish just won‚Äôt get to eat.What to expect?Thinking through what happens next is tough, as there are many plausible outcomes but the one I am coming back to is the meme that I mentioned at the start of this article, inscriptions will be priced out. Just run the numbers, they don‚Äôt lie. I don‚Äôt think we are anywhere near inscriptions dying in the short term, but there will come a point in time where it is just too expensive for dumb things to exist on chain. Low time preference activities will prevail.I see the overall inscription ecosystem continuing to evolve and that means people‚Äôs minds and opinions will continue to change too. We are seeing thoughtful commentary from devs5 warning6 of how changing the protocol to address or eliminate inscriptions usage will only push people to ‚Äúexploit‚Äù other parts of the protocol for it‚Äôs precious blockspace. We are seeing novel new ways to crowd fund inscriptions and incentive the seeding of data via bitcoin + torrents such as ReQuest, Durabit, and Precursive Inscriptions. Inscriptions are a thing, blockspace is precious, and people are willing to pay for it. Bitcoin is for enemies, and it is going to get weird(er). Cope and seethe but remember to have fun.Reasonable is subjective, markets clear. I believe I saw transactions with fees as high as 20 sat/vbyte being purged, which in recent memory feels absurd. ‚Ü©Ô∏éDemystifying Hashprice ‚Ü©Ô∏éSatsflow Scenarios ‚Ü©Ô∏éSomeone made this and it is pretty handy. I used this formula to build out my table in google sheets. https://instacalc.com/56229 ‚Ü©Ô∏é‚ÄúConcept NACK.I do not believe this to be in the interest of users of our software. The point of participating in transaction relay and having a mempool is being able to make a prediction about what the next blocks will look like. Intentionally excluding transactions for which a very clear (however stupid) economic demand exists breaks that ability, without even removing the need to validate them when they get mined.Of course, anyone is free to run, or provide, software that relays/keeps/mines whatever they want, but if your goal isn‚Äôt to have a realistic mempool, you can just as well run in -blocksonly mode. This has significantly greater resource savings, if that is the goal.To the extent that this is an attempt to not just not see certain transactions, but also to discourage their use, this will at best cause those transactions to be routed around nodes implementing this, or at worst result in a practice of transactions submitted directly to miners, which has serious risks for the centralization of mining. While non-standardness has historically been used to discourage burdensome practices, I believe this is (a) far less relevant these days where full blocks are the norm so it won‚Äôt reduce node operation costs anyway and (b) powerless to stop transactions for which an existing market already exists ‚Äì one which pays dozens of BTC in fee per day.I believe the demand for blockspace many of these transactions pose is grossly misguided, but choosing to not see them is burying your head in the sand.‚Äù ‚Äì Peter Wuille Link ‚Ü©Ô∏é‚ÄúEver since the infamous Taproot Wizard 4mb block bitcoiners have been alight, fighting to try and stop inscriptions.

        "summary": "Gold is pitched as a natural and proven analog to Bitcoin, but the environmental cost of gold production is materially more damaging than Bitcoin.",
        "content": "King Ferdinand of Spain, sponsor of Christopher Columbus, had only one command for the conquistadors: ‚ÄúGet Gold! Humanely, if possible, but at all hazards!‚Äù 500 years later this sentiment still seems to be the same, with the addition of new hazards. Gold bugs and Bitcoin advocates share the common belief that the fiat currency system is on the brink of collapse, while continuously debasing itself to stay alive. The solution? A commodity-based alternative that ensures the preservation of accrued value, impervious to debasement.With the upcoming 4th halving of the block subsidy from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC in April 2024 the inflation rate (annual growth rate of total supply) of Bitcoin will be 0.9%. Additionally to its higher portability and divisibility than conventional gold, the ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äôs‚Äù inflation rate will be lower than gold‚Äôs inflation rate (~ 1.7%) and continue to drop to lower rates in the future.But when asked for their choice of a store of value, many investors say things like:‚ÄúI‚Äôd choose gold. Not Bitcoin, because of the environment!‚Äù Really?! Contrary to that perception, research tells us that Bitcoin mining can enhance renewable energy expansion (Bastian-Pinto 2021, Rudd 2023; Iba√±ez 2023; Lal 2023) and incentivize methane emission reduction (Rudd 2023, Neum√ºller 2023) while having half of the carbon footprint (70 Mt CO2e) of gold mining (126 Mt CO2e).When people think of gold, they think of a pure and clean substance. The reality of gold production, however, looks very different. As I have watched environmental scientists developing water pollutant adsorbers, I have learned that gold mining is one of the most polluting industries in the world. Further digging into the topic leads to the following facts.Gold mining ranks second after coal mining (7200 km2) in land coverage. Gold mining sites (4600 km2) cover more than the next 3 metal sites combined (copper: 1700 km2, iron: 1300 km2 and aluminum: 470 km2).As many high yield gold mines have been exhausted, chemical processes, like cyanide-leaching or amalgamation, with extensive use of toxic chemicals are being used today. The contaminated water from gold mining called acid mine drainage is a toxic cocktail for aquatic life and works its way into the food chain. \n\nColorado‚Äôs Animas River turned yellow after the Gold King Mine spill of 3 million gallons of toxic waste water in August 2015. From: In the U.S., 90% of the cyanide is used solely to recover hard-to-extract gold. The toxic material and its production and transport is in direct relationship with the gold market. It is estimated that gold mines use more than 100,000 tons of cyanide each year. That means massive production and transport of a compound with a human fatal dose of a few milligrams.In 2000, a tailings dam at a gold mine in Romania failed and 100,000 m3 of cyanide-contaminated water went into the Danube River watershed. The spill caused a mass die-off of aquatic life in the river ecosystem and contaminated the drinking water of 2.5 million Hungarians. Mines in Brazil and China widely use the historic amalgamation method that creates mercury waste. Roughly 1 kg mercury is emitted for 1 kg of mined gold. Gold production from artisanal and small-scale mines, mostly in the global South, accounts for 38% of global mercury emissions. Thousands of tons have been discharged into the environment in Latin America since 1980. 15 million small scale mine workers were exposed to mercury vapor and the residents of downstream communities ate fish heavily contaminated with methylmercury. Mercury poisoning among these populations causes severe neurological issues, such as vision and hearing loss, seizures, and memory problems. Similarly, in the townships of Johannesburg in South Africa, poor communities are paying the price for the country‚Äôs rich gold mining past.Knowing about the risks, western mining companies have moved increasingly to developing countries as a response to stricter environmental and labor regulations at home. Surprisingly, only 7% of mined gold is used for material property purposes in industry (e.g., in electronics). The rest is processed for jewelry (46%) or directly purchased as a store of value by retail or central banks (47%). That‚Äôs why periods of high monetary debasement are boosting the price of gold. Last year central banks bought 1000 tons of bullion, the most ever recorded, while gold has been hovering close to its nominal all-time high (status: December 2023).The last time gold demand increased its price substantially was the monetary debasement following the 2008 global financial crisis. During that time gold mining in western Amazonian forests of Peru increased by 400%, while the average annual rate of forest loss tripled. As virtually all of Peru's mercury imports are used in gold mining, the gold price corresponded with an exponential increase in Peruvian mercury imports.As a result of the artisanal mercury handling, large quantities of mercury were being released into the atmosphere, sediments and waterways. The massive mercury exposure can be detected in birds in central America. A region that supports over half of the world‚Äôs species.\n\nFigure 1: Gold price, Peruvian mercury imports and mining area, from ‚ÄúGold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon: Global Prices, Deforestation, and Mercury Imports.‚Äù 2011, PLoS ONE 6(4): e18875. Other natural areas endowed with gold deposits like the Magadan Region in Northeast Russia are experiencing similar expanding mining activity over the past years including environmental destruction in response to high gold prices. Gold mining, largely driven by demand for a store of value, causes widespread ecological and social harm across the world. It is the coal of value storage mediums.At least half of today‚Äôs gold mining could be prevented by using a different store of value - a digital commodity with higher portability, divisibility and scarcity.So, next time an environmental conscious investor argues for gold vs. Bitcoin, tell them:A 21st century store of value should not rely on huge carved out fields of destruction and poisonous hazards but on electricity from non-rival energy, subsidizing renewable expansion.

        "content": "The fourth Bitcoin halving is almost upon us, and this one has the potential for some very interesting surprises. This halving marks the reduction of the Bitcoin supply subsidy from 6.25 BTC every block to 3.125 BTC per block. These supply reductions occur every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, as part of Bitcoin‚Äôs gradual, disinflationary approach to its final capped supply in circulation. The finite supply of 21 million coins is a, if not the, foundational characteristic of Bitcoin. This predictability of supply and inflation rate has been at the heart of what has driven demand and belief in bitcoin as a superior form of money. The regular supply halving is the mechanism by which that finite supply is ultimately enacted. The halvings over time are the driver behind one of the most fundamental shifts of Bitcoin incentives in the long term: the move from miners being funded by newly issued coins from the coinbase subsidy ‚Äî the block reward ‚Äî to being funded dominantly by the transaction fee revenue from users moving bitcoin on-chain. As Satoshi said in Section 6 (Incentives) of the whitepaper: ‚ÄúThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.‚ÄùHistorically the halving has correlated with a massive appreciation in the price of bitcoin, offsetting the impact of the miners‚Äô subsidy being cut in half. Miners‚Äô bills are paid in fiat, meaning that if the price of bitcoin appreciates, resulting in a larger income in dollar terms for the lower amount of bitcoin earned per block, the negative impact on mining operation is cushioned. In light of the last market cycle, with not even a 4x appreciation from the prior all time high, the degree to which price appreciation will cushion miners from the effects of the halving is an assumption that might not consistently hold true. This coming halving, the inflation rate of bitcoin will drop for the first time below 1%. If the next market cycle plays out similarly to the previous one, with much lower upwards movement than seen historically, this halving could have a materially negative impact on existing miners. This makes the fee revenue miners can collect from transactions more important than ever, and it will continue to become more central to their sustainability from a business perspective as block height increases and successive halvings occur. Either fee revenue has to increase, or the price needs to appreciate at a minimum by 2x each halving in order to make up for the decrease in subsidy revenue. As bullish as most Bitcoiners can be, the notion that a doubling in price is guaranteed to happen every four years, in perpetuity, is a dubious assumption at best. Love them or hate them, BRC-20 tokens and Inscriptions have shifted the entire dynamic of the mempool, pushing fees from somewhere in the ballpark of 0.1-0.2 BTC per block prior to their existence, to the somewhat volatile average of 1-2 BTC as of late ‚Äî regularly spiking far in excess of that. The New Factor This TimeOrdinals present a very new incentive dynamic to the halving this go around that was not present at any prior halving in Bitcoin‚Äôs history. Rare sats. At the heart of Ordinals Theory is that satoshis from specific blocks can be tracked and ‚Äúowned‚Äù based on its arbitrary interpretation of the transaction history of the blockchain, based on assuming specific amounts sent to specific outputs ‚Äúsend that sat‚Äù there. The other aspect of the theory is assigning rarity values to specific sats. Each block has a coinbase, thus producing an ordinal. But each block is different in importance to the scheme. Each normal block produces an ‚Äúuncommon‚Äù sat, the first block of each difficulty adjustment produces a ‚Äúrare‚Äù sat, and the first block of each halving cycle produces an ‚Äúepic‚Äù sat. This halving will be the first one since the widespread adoption of Ordinal Theory by a subset of Bitcoin users. There has never been the production of an ‚Äúepic‚Äù sat while there was material market demand for it from a large and developed ecosystem. The market demand for that specific sat could wind up being valued at absurd multiples of what the coinbase reward itself is valued at in terms of just fungible satoshis. The fact that a large market segment in the Bitcoin space would value that single coinbase drastically higher than any other creates an incentive for miners to fight over it by reorganizing the blockchain immediately after the halving. The only time such a thing has happened in history was during the very first halving, when the block reward decreased from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. Some miners continued trying to mine blocks rewarding 50 BTC in the coinbase after the supply cut, and gave up shortly after when the rest of the network ignored their efforts. This time around, the incentive to reorg isn‚Äôt based around ignoring the consensus rules and hoping people come along to your side, it's fighting over who is allowed to mine a completely valid block because of the value collectors will ascribe to that single coinbase. There are no guarantees that such a reorg will actually occur, but there is a very large financial incentive for miners to do so. If it does occur, the length for which it will go on ultimately depends on how much that ‚Äúepic‚Äù sat could be worth on the market to pay for the lost revenue from fighting over a single block rather than progressing the chain. Each halving in Bitcoin‚Äôs history has been a pivotal event people watch, but this go around it has the potential to be much more interesting than past halvings. How An Epic Sat Battle Could Play OutThere are a few ways this could play out in my opinion. The first and most obvious way is that nothing happens. For whatever reason, miners do not judge that the potential market value of the first ‚Äúepic‚Äù sat mined since Ordinals adoption took off is worth the opportunity cost of wasting energy reorging the blockchain and foregoing the money they could make by simply mining the next block. If miners do not think the extra premium the ordinal can fetch is worth the cost of giving up moving on to the next block, they simply won‚Äôt do it. The next possibility is a result of nuanced scales of economy. Imagine a larger scale mining operation can afford to risk more ‚Äúlost blocks‚Äù engaging in a reorg fight over the ‚Äúepic‚Äù sat. That larger miner with more capital to put on the table can afford to take a larger risk. In this scenario, we might see a few odd reorg attempts by larger miners with smaller operations not even trying, and essentially minimal disruption. This would play out if miners think there is some premium they can acquire for the ordinal, but not a massive premium worth serious disruption to the network. The last scenario would be if a market develops bidding for the ‚Äúepic‚Äù sat ahead of time, and miners can have a clear picture that the ordinal is valued massively above the market value of the fungible sat itself. In this case, miners may fight over that block for an extended period of time. The logic behind not reorging the blockchain is that you are losing money, you are not only forgoing the reward of just mining the next block, but you are also continuing to incur the cost of running your mining operations. In a situation where the market is publicly signaling how much the ‚Äúepic‚Äù sat is worth, miners have a very clear idea of how long they can forgo moving onto the next block and still wind up with a net profit by attaining the post-halving coinbase reward with the ordinal. In this scenario the network could see substantial disruption until miners begin approaching the point of incurring a guaranteed loss even if they do successfully wind up mining this block without it being reorged. Regardless of which way things actually play out, this is going to be a factor to consider each halving going forward unless the demand and marketplace for ordinals dies off.¬†",

        "summary": "MEV, or Miner Extractable Value, is a serious problem that any blockchain is going to have to deal with. The only question is how severe will it get based on what features any given blockchain supports. So how bad can it get?",
        "content": "The core of Bitcoin‚Äôs security model relies on this basic game theory‚Äîminers, armed with their digital pickaxes, are in a relentless chase for profit. And it‚Äôs this pursuit that keeps the network secure. Basic vanilla mining involves producing blocks to earn the block rewards and transaction fees, but have you ever considered that miners might have other ways to extract value from the blockchain beyond this standard mining process? Are there other avenues for profit on the blockchain where miners can leverage their unique position as validators?What is MEV?In proof-of-work systems, ‚ÄúMiner Extractable Value‚Äù (MEV) is a term that describes the profits miners can earn by manipulating how transactions are prioritized, excluded, rearranged, or altered in the blocks they mine. However, since Ethereum‚Äôs upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, which moved the network to proof-of-stake, the concept of MEV has taken on a new name and is now referred to as ‚ÄúMaximal Extractable Value‚Äù in proof-of-stake systems. In this context, it‚Äôs the block proposers instead of miners‚Äîwho are the validators‚Äîthat have the opportunity to extract this value.Miners (or validators in Ethereum) have a special role in these networks confirming transactions in blocks. Their position places them a step ahead of other users and allows them to determine the final order of transactions in the chain. Inside a block, transactions are typically ordered with the highest fees at the top, but every now and again opportunities open up that would allow miners to take an additional profit by strategically changing the order of transactions for their own benefit. You might think, what‚Äôs the harm in letting miners take a bit of extra profit off the top? The concerns only start to crop up when some of these miners, those equipped with more advanced analytical capabilities and more powerful computing, can identify and exploit MEV profit opportunities more effectively than others. These opportunities might not always be easy to spot, but the more value that can be extracted through analyzing the chain, the stronger the incentive becomes for research teams equipped with bots to do this work. Over time, this disparity in miner's profit-making ability creates a trend toward centralization within the network. Ultimately undermining the core principle of the blockchain: decentralization.This is exactly the scenario the Bitcoin developer community is aiming to prevent when considering how best to manage more expressivity on Bitcoin.Why Do We Want Programmable Money?Historically, Bitcoin has operated with relatively simple smart contracts. However, this model struggles with even moderately complex transactions. Bitcoin Script can only validate authentication data, it doesn‚Äôt have the capability to impose speed limits on transactions or define coin destinations because Bitcoin Script doesn‚Äôt have access to transaction data.As a somewhat separate issue, working with and writing Bitcoin smart contracts can be challenging for users who don't fully grasp its security requirements. A proposed feature, known as ‚Äòvaults,‚Äô aims to solve some of these pain points by introducing time-locked conditions for transactions. Essentially, vaults could serve as an emergency ‚Äúescape hatch,‚Äù allowing users to recover their funds in the event of compromised private keys. But features like this are only possible with more expressivity.Ethereum is widely recognized for its highly expressive scripting capabilities, but it also notably struggles with the issue of MEV. Most users generally assume that Bitcoin has no MEV, in stark contrast to Ethereum, which is viewed as a wild frontier for it. But is this the full story? Do more expressive smart contracts automatically incentivize more MEV scenarios?There are several factors that contribute to MEV: (1) mempool transparency, (2) smart contract transparency, and (3) smart contract expressivity. Each of these factors opens up new channels for MEV, we‚Äôll review each here.The Bad: (1) Mempool TransparencyLike Bitcoin's mempool, the mempools of most blockchains are fully transparent, open, and visible, so that everyone can see what transactions are pending before being validated and confirmed in a block. Bitcoin blocks typically take about 10 minutes to find, which theoretically gives miners that same amount of time to take advantage and front-run. In practice, on Bitcoin, this isn‚Äôt a source of MEV for a few reasons: (1) Bitcoin transactions are simple enough that no miners have a significant analytic advantage over other miners, and (2) Bitcoin transactions generally don‚Äôt execute multi-asset transactions such as swaps or open trades that could be front-run.Contrast this with Ethereum, which has some of the most complex multi-asset transactions taking place on public decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Officially the block time on Ethereum is 15 seconds, but during periods of high mempool traffic, the required gas fees for immediate block inclusion can easily exceed a hundred dollars. As a result, transactions with lower fees end up waiting minutes or even hours before being included in a block. This can extend the window for these nefarious front-running opportunities, already more prevalent on Ethereum due to the substantial value wrapped up in layer-2 tokens.The Bad: (2) Smart Contract TransparencyIn Bitcoin ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù are the simple locking and unlocking mechanism inherent in Bitcoin Script. The transaction values, sender, and receiver details are all publicly visible on the blockchain. While this complete and naked transparency isn‚Äôt ideal from a privacy perspective, it‚Äôs part of how Bitcoin allows all participants in the network to verify the full state of the blockchain. Any observer can analyze these contract details, potentially opening the door to certain MEV-related strategies.But the Bitcoin scripting language is, by design, quite limited, focusing primarily on the basic functions of sending and receiving funds, and validating transactions with signatures or hashlocks. This simplicity inherently limits the scope for MEV strategies on Bitcoin, making such opportunities relatively scarce compared to other chains.Platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano also have fully transparent smart contracts, but they diverge from Bitcoin by also having highly complex and expressive scripting languages. Their Turing-complete systems make it possible to theoretically execute virtually any computational task which has come to include: self-executing contracts, integration of real-world data through oracles, decentralized applications (dApps), layer-2 tokens, swaps within DEXs, and automated market makers (AMMs). These come together to foster a rich environment for MEV opportunities. Zero-knowledge-proof-based schemes, such as STARKex, could theoretically avoid some of these issues, but this trade-off would come with other complexities.The Ugly: (3) Smart Contract ExpressivityThe MEV opportunities are so lucrative on some chains that there are ‚ÄúMEV trading firms‚Äù bringing in ‚Äúhigh five figures, mid six figures‚Äù in profits a month. This trend has become so prominent that there are public dashboards dedicated to scanning for profitable opportunities on Ethereum and Solana. Their profitability is generated by executing the full basket of MEV strategies: front-running, sandwich trading, token arbitrage, back-running, and liquidations to name a few. Each exploiting a different smart contract dynamics for profit. Some of these MEV strategies apply to both layer-1 and layer-2.Generalized Front-Running: Bots scan the mempool for profitable transactions, and then front-run the original transaction for a profit.Sandwich Trading: The attacker places orders both before and after a large transaction to manipulate asset prices for profit. This strategy leverages the predictable price movement caused by the large transaction.Then certain strategies are unique to layer-2 tokens and smart contracts.Arbitrage Across Different DEXs: Bots exploit price differences for the same asset on various DEXs by buying low on one and selling high on another.Back-running in DeFi Bonding Curves: MEV bots capitalize on predictable price rises in DeFi bonding curves by placing transactions immediately after large ones, buying during uptrends, and selling for profit. DeFi Liquidations: MEV bots spot opportunities in DeFi lending where collateral values fall below set thresholds, allowing validator's to prioritize their transactions for buying the liquidated collateral at lower prices.The complexity of contracts significantly contributes to the challenges associated with MEV.Re-entrancy Attacks: These attacks exploit smart contract logic flaws, allowing attackers to repeatedly call a function before the first execution completes, extracting funds multiple times. In the context of MEV, skilled individuals can significantly profit from this, particularly in contracts with substantial funds.Interconnected Contracts and Global State: On platforms like Ethereum, smart contracts can interact, leading to chain reactions across several contracts from a single transaction. This interconnectivity enables complex MEV strategies, where a transaction in one contract may impact another, offering a chain reaction of profit opportunities.Part of the problem here is that the total value created by tokens and dApps built on layer-2 often exceeds the value of the blockchain‚Äôs native asset on layer-1, undermining the validators incentive to select and confirm transactions purely based on fees.To make matters worse, many of these opportunities are not strictly limited to network validators. Other network participants with MEV scanning bots can compete for these same opportunities, causing network congestion, raising gas fees, and elevating transaction costs. This scenario creates a negative externality for the network and its users, who are all affected by the price of higher transaction fees, as the chain becomes less efficient and more expensive to operate. MEV in DeFi is so common that users have almost accepted it as an invisible tax on everyone in the network.Do these MEV opportunities naturally emerge as a byproduct of the highly expressive smart contracts, or is there an alternative route to the dream of fully programmable money?Short of avoiding protocols with highly expressive smart contracts and layer-2 tokens, users can avoid some of these risks by utilizing protocols that support Confidential Transactions, like Liquid, that conceal transaction details. But unlike these platforms with more expressive scripting languages, Bitcoin lacks the ability to do things you would expect to be able to do with programmable money.The Good: Trade-Offs to Programmable MoneyWhen considering the evolution of smart contracts on Bitcoin the options we‚Äôre given are to (1) push the complexity off-chain, (2) cautiously integrate narrow or limited covenant functionalities, or (3) embrace the path of full expressivity. Let‚Äôs explore some of the proposals from each of these options.(1) A New Structure for Off-Chain Contracts: ANYPREVOUTOff-chain solutions, like the Lightning Network, aim to enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs scalability and functionality without burdening the mainchain, keeping transactions fast and fees low. This all sounds good so far.SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT (APO) is a proposal for a new type of public key that allows certain adjustments to a transaction even after it‚Äôs signed. It simplifies how transactions are updated, allowing transactions to refer to previous (UTXOs) more easily, making Lightning Network channels faster, cheaper, safer, and more straightforward, especially in resolving disputes.Under the hood, APO is a new proposed type of sighash flag. Every Bitcoin transaction must have a signature to prove it‚Äôs legitimate. When creating this signature, you use a ‚Äúsighash flag‚Äù to determine which parts of the transaction you‚Äôre signing. With APO a sender would sign all outputs and none of the inputs, to commit the outputs of the transaction, but not specifically which transaction the funds are going to come from. APO enables Eltoo, allowing users to exchange pre-signed transactions off-chain. However APO may inadvertently introduce MEV by making transactions reorderable. As soon as you allow a signature that‚Äôs binding the transaction graph you have the ability to swap out transactions. Inputs can be swapped, as long as the new inputs are still compatible with the signature.(2) Covenants: CAT + CSFS and CTVCovenants would allow users to control where coins can move, by imposing speed limits or setting specific destinations for coins in a transaction. There are two different categories of covenants: recursive and non-recursive.Recursive covenants allow coins to continually return to covenants of the same type.Non-recursive covenants limit this control to the next transaction, requiring the entire future path of the coins to be defined upfront.CAT + CSFS is a covenant proposal that allows scripts to construct or define certain parts of a future transaction. CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS) verifies a signature against the data that OP_CAT constructed. By using CSFS to require the signature to match some dynamically constructed format from OP_CAT, we can define how these UTXOs can be spent in the future and create a recursive covenant, albeit clunkily.OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV) is a way of creating non-recursive covenants. Instead of defining and verifying against specific parts of a transaction, CTV restricts how funds can be spent, without specifying the exact next address they must go to. It defines a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù that the next transaction has to confirm.One risk with recursive covenants might be possible to create a scenario where coins must follow a set of rules that repeat over and over, that get trapped in a loop without a way of getting out. Another is that, because covenants are transparent and self-executing they could open Bitcoin up to some of the MEV strategies we see on other chains.What is the good news here?The good news is that these proposals all introduce new expressivity!Now what is the maximum amount of expressivity we can get?(3) Full Expressivity: SimplicitySimplicity is a blockchain-based programming language that differs from other scripting languages in that it is very low-level. It is not a language on top of Bitcoin Script or a new opcode within it, it‚Äôs an alternative to it. Theoretically, it‚Äôs possible to implement all covenant proposals within Simplicity, and implement many of the other contracts cypherpunks want from programmable money, but with less of the negative externalities of Ethereum. Simplicity maintains Bitcoin‚Äôs design principle of self-contained transactions whereby programs do not have access to any information outside the transaction. Designed for both maximal expressiveness and safety, Simplicity supports formal verification and static analysis, giving users more reliable smart contracts.Compare Simplicity to: (1) bitcoin covenant proposals and (2) scripting languages on other blockchains:\n\nThe covenant proposals on Bitcoin Script, though much simpler than Simplicity, lack the expressivity to handle fee estimation in Script, due to Bitcoin's lack of arithmetic functions. There is no way to multiply or divide, no conditionals or stack manipulations opcodes; it is also very hard to estimate a reasonable fee to be associated with a given contract or covenant. Users end up with spaghetti code, where 80% of their contract logic is dedicated to trying to determine what their fee rate should be. Making these covenant contracts super complicated and difficult to reason about.The EVM has looping constructs which makes static analysis of gas usage very difficult. Whereas with Script or Simplicity, you can just count each opcode, or recursively add up the cost of each function. Because Simplicity has a formal model, you can formally reason about program behavior. You can't do this with Script even though you can do static analysis of resource usage.Simplicity would provide users with the highest degree of expressiveness, along with other valuable features like static analysis and formal verification. Users are incentivized, though not restricted, to build smart contracts that are resistant to MEV. Additionally, a combination of different contracts together may give rise to MEV, even when individually they do not. This represents a fundamental trade-off.The idea of advancing Bitcoin‚Äôs smart contract functionality is undeniably promising and exciting. But it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that all these proposals carry some degree of MEV risk‚Äîalbeit likely not to the extent that we see on other chains. As we think about bringing more programmable money to Bitcoin, there are questions we have to ask: Can we build a protocol with zero MEV risk, or is this an unattainable ideal?Given the inherent risks of MEV in many proposals, what level of MEV risk is acceptable?And finally, what represents the simplest proposal that offers the greatest degree of expressivity?Each proposal has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. However, regardless of the direction we take, we should always aim to prioritize security and uphold the principle of decentralization.For detailed updates and more information, keep an eye on the Blockstream Research ùïè feed.This is a guest post by Kiara Bickers.

        "summary": "Managing a fund in the Bitcoin space introduces challenges and complexities that traditional hedge funds from legacy finance do not have to confront.",
        "content": "¬†After FTX collapsed, scornful critics widely ridiculed Caroline Ellison's approach to stop losses. 'I just don't don't think they're an effective risk management tool,' she infamously told an audience during FTX's heyday. But did she have a point?Venturing into the crypto asset management realm presents a unique set of challenges that differ widely from the traditional fund space. In this primer piece, we will delve into the obstacles that aspiring fund managers face when launching a bitcoin sector fund and examine the key differences that exist when you step outside the world of traditional asset management.Volatility and Risk ManagementOne of the most significant challenges faced by bitcoin sector funds is the extreme volatility that exists within the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin's price has witnessed strong bullish surges, driving excitement among investors. However, it has also experienced strong bearish declines, leading to substantial losses for those unprepared for such price swings. Managing risk in such a dynamic environment requires sophisticated strategies, rigorous risk frameworks and assessments, and a deep understanding of market trends.\n\nUnlike most traditional and mainstream blue chip assets, which often experience relatively stable price movements, bitcoin's price can change meaningfully within a matter of hours. Consequently, bitcoin sector fund managers must be well-equipped to handle sudden price fluctuations to protect their investors' capital. Traditional stop loss structures may not work to the extent expected, as the closing market order may get executed far below the preset trigger price due to orderbook slippage and rapid price movements, the proverbial ‚Äúcatching of a falling knife‚Äù. Using tight stop losses as a foundational risk management mechanism can be your enemy. For example, in a flash crash scenario, positions may be automatically sold at a loss even though the market reverted a few minutes (or seconds) later.While stop losses are an alternative, they‚Äôre not an option! Options are contracts you can buy that give you the right to buy or sell a given asset at a predetermined price (i.e., the strike price) at a given time (i.e., the expiration date). An option to buy an asset is a call and an option to sell one is a put. Buying an out-of-the-money put (i.e., far below the current price) can act as a floor on your potential losses if the price collapses. Think of it as a premium paid to insure your position. Sometimes to defend against binary result events or particularly high volatility timeframes you just have to flatten your positions and take no risk, living to fight another day in the bitcoin market. Think for example of key protocol update dates, regulatory decisions or the next Bitcoin halving; though note the market moves ahead of those events so you may have to take action beforehand. Creating an effective risk management plan for a bitcoin sector fund may involve using various hedging techniques, product and instrument diversification (potentially across asset classes), trading venue risk scoring and risk-adjusted allocations, dynamic trade sizing, dynamic leverage settings, and employing robust analytical tools to monitor market sentiment and potential market and operational risks. Custody and SecurityThe custody of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a critical aspect that distinguishes bitcoin sector funds from their traditional counterparts. One key difference is that unlike traditional exchanges that only match orders, bitcoin exchanges do the order matching, margining, settlement, and custody of the assets. The exchange itself becomes the clearinghouse, concentrating counterparty risk as opposed to alleviating it. Decentralized exchanges come with a unique set of risks as well, from fending off miner-extracted value to being ready to move assets in case of a protocol or bridge hack.For these reasons, safeguarding digital assets from theft or hacking requires robust security measures, including but not limited to multi-signature protocols, cold storage solutions, and risk monitoring tools. The responsibility of securely managing private keys and choosing and monitoring reliable trading venues rests entirely with the fund manager. The burden to monitor the market infrastructure itself introduces a level of technical complexity absent in traditional fund management where custody and settlement are standardized and commoditized standalone systems.\n\nCustodial solutions for bitcoin sector funds must be carefully selected, ensuring that assets are protected against cyberattacks and insider threats. With the history of high-profile cryptocurrency exchange hacks, investors are particularly concerned about the safety of their assets; any breach in security could lead to significant financial losses and damage the reputation of the fund.ConclusionLaunching a bitcoin sector fund is a thrilling endeavor that offers unprecedented opportunities for investors seeking exposure to the fast-growing cryptocurrency market. It is important, however, to understand that launching a fund is no easy feat with pitfalls going beyond the success of the trading strategy. It is no surprise that every quarter the fund closures are in the same range of fund launches. \n\nThose entering the bitcoin sector fund space should approach it with a pioneering spirit, stay informed, and embrace the dynamic nature of this exciting emerging market. While the road may be challenging, the potential rewards for successful bitcoin sector fund managers could be astronomical.

        "summary": "Lightning has offered a path to massively improve the scalability of transactions conducted using Bitcoin, but has offered no meaningful path to scaling the ownership of coins on the network. CTV opens the door to addressing that missing piece of the scaling puzzle.",
        "content": "OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY has once again become a focal point in the conversation about improvements to scale Bitcoin. This time around there are many more alternative designs for covenants being proposed, and actual concrete designs that make use of CTV as scaling solutions (Timeout Trees and Ark). The conversation has a much larger depth of concepts to take into consideration, both in terms of alternatives that could be adopted as well as concrete proposals that CTV could enable. One narrative circulating from the camp of people against CTV is that ‚ÄúCTV doesn‚Äôt scale Bitcoin.‚Äù Let‚Äôs charitably interpret that to mean that CTV itself does not scale Bitcoin, things you can build with it do. Well, then that is not a coherent argument. Segregated Witness did not scale Bitcoin. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY did not scale Bitcoin. But the Lightning Network, which those three proposals enabled, do scale Bitcoin. They add a massive amount of overhead for transactional throughput to grow beyond the constraints of the blockchain itself. Lightning literally couldn‚Äôt exist without those base layer primitives. The problem with Lightning though, is it only scales the number of transactions that can be processed. It does not in any way help improve the scalability of ownership over UTXOs, or increase the number of users who can control one. Lightning is currently not capable of doing that with its current design and the current set of consensus primitives available in Bitcoin script. CTV can change that. UTXOs And Virtual UTXOsPart of the problem of Lightning‚Äôs shortcoming regarding scalability of Bitcoin ownership is that in order to open a channel, or control a UTXO, you actually have to transact on the base layer. After that Lightning can facilitate a very large number of transactions off-chain, but a user must still transact on-chain to onboard themselves to Lightning. It massively increases the number of transactions Bitcoin can process, but it does nothing at all to increase the number of people who can own bitcoin. This is another big problem CTV can help with. Burak coined the term ‚Äúvirtual UTXO‚Äù for his Ark proposal, but I think this terminology is a perfect general term useful far beyond the context of Ark. A virtual UTXO is one committed to being created in the future, through mechanisms like a pre-signed transaction, but that hasn‚Äôt actually been created on-chain yet. Bitcoin does not have the blockspace for everyone to create a single UTXO at the scale of the world population, but there is definitely potential for people to have their own independent virtual UTXO if the process of committing to those can be made scalable. Scaling the creation of commitments to vUTXOs is the problem. Right now there is no way to create them except through the use of pre-signed transactions, and this introduces a bottleneck that must be addressed. The number of vUTXOs any real UTXO can commit to is bounded by the size of the multisig set signing these transactions. To trustlessly create vUTXOs, the owner of every vUTXO must be part of the multisig key that is signing the transactions that commit to creating them, otherwise they have no guarantee that conflicting transactions will not be generated that voids their ability to claim their vUTXO if necessary. The problem of coordinating the signing of this between every member of the set introduces practical considerations that will ultimately severely limit the size any pool of vUTXOs can grow to. The only other alternative is to have some trusted party or parties sign the transactions committing to everyone‚Äôs vUTXOs, and simply trusting them to not steal those funds from the rightful owners. CTV offers a solution to both of these problems. By being able to non-interactively commit to a set of future transactions the same way pre-signed transactions do, but without requiring every owner of the vUTXOs those transactions create to coordinate signing, it solves the coordination problem. At the same time because no one needs to interact, a single person could take the role of funding the CTV output that commits to everyone‚Äôs vUTXOs unfurling on-chain, and zero trust in that person after the funding transaction is confirmed is required. Once that real UTXO is confirmed in a block, the person who funded it has no ability to undo or double spend the future transactions it has committed to. Keep in mind that a vUTXO can be whatever you want it to be. It can be a Lightning channel, a multisig script for cold storage, etc. CTV does what the current form of Lightning does not, it scales actual ownership of Bitcoin, not just the number of transactions it can process. Cut Through The ShortcutOne of the other criticisms of CTV as ‚Äúnot scaling Bitcoin‚Äù is that by committing to future transactions you do not escape the need to put them on-chain eventually, and so therefore CTV doesn‚Äôt actually help improve scalability. I like to call this ‚Äúthe OP_IF fallacy.‚Äù i.e. once people start talking about CTV they forget OP_IF exists, and that scripts can actually have multiple spending conditions to choose from. The most powerful things about Taproot are the ability to construct multisigs by just adding two public keys together and sign for them with a single aggregate signatures, and to only selectively reveal a single ‚ÄúIF‚Äù branch of a script that has multiple ways to be spent. Combined with CTV, this offers a very powerful way to make use of vUTXO commitments. Rather than make a chain of transactions using purely CTV, they can be constructed with the CTV spending path buried inside a taproot tree. The end of the chain of transactions are all the individual vUTXOs each participant owns, locked to that user‚Äôs public key alone. As you go backwards towards the root of the tree, each set of keys that are below any node in the tree can simply be added together and used as the Schnorr multisig key that the CTV spend path is buried under. This means that at any point in the chain of transactions unfurling on-chain to actually turn the vUTXOs into real UTXOs where you can get every participant in an intermediate UTXO to coordinate with each other, everyone can simply cooperatively sign a transaction moving their coins where they want to go in a more efficient way than simply letting the pre-defined transaction flow unfurl all the way to morph their vUTXOs into real ones. This allows small sub groups to escape needing to actually unfurl the entire set of transactions pre-committed to on-chain, without introducing any trusted parties to rely on or weakening the security of each user‚Äôs claim to their own vUTXOs. These two simple realities offer a massive gain in scalability for Bitcoin without compromising on individual sovereignty or security in doing so, and all we need in order to realize them is CTV. Acknowledgements: I would like to thank everyone who participates at the Chicago Bitdevs for helping me formulate these observations in a concise way through discussion.¬†",

        "summary": "Everything you do in life consumes energy from somewhere, it is fundamental to the nature of the universe. This is the key factor that makes Bitcoin a workable system and provides its security.",
        "content": "Have you ever looked at the stars and noticed how everything in the universe seems connected? Famous inventor and engineer, Nikola Tesla, thought that this connection is all about energy, how often things vibrate, and the way they move. I believe that as well; our perceptions of every aspect of life can be perceived as a transfer of energy, a simple equation. Let's take a moment to view the seemingly random interactions in the world as their own version of an energy transaction. The following analogies are different ways to help us think about energy, especially how we use it and share it while also respecting nature's wisdom. Then, of course, we‚Äôll circle back to how this all relates to understanding how Bitcoin fits into‚Ä¶ dare I say ‚Äúfixes‚Äù‚Ä¶ this.Focusing on the internal, energy flows in numerous ways. To have the requisite energy to win the day, I must feed my body a necessary amount of nutrients. Calories are literally a unit of energy in food. I‚Äôve learned a lot recently about the benefits of eating quality proteins (like steak & eggs) as well as the negatives of processed foods, seed oils, etc. The quality of this energy informs the quality of my thoughts and words because we are what we eat, which directly affects my level of inflammation as well as my emotional state. If I don‚Äôt charge my battery through quality sleep, I won‚Äôt have enough energy to get through the day. My grandfather always said ‚Äúearly to bed and early to rise makes a young man healthy, wealthy, and wise.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard not to see all of those positive attributes as a result of maintaining the storage of energy.In my personal interactions throughout the day, I‚Äôve come to the point in my life where I can visualize each connection as a transfer of energy. I see my morning embrace with my wife and kids as a synergistic energy builder; we each walk away more emotionally charged because of it. As I teach throughout the day, I need to keep my energy up in order to be the catalyst, energizing my students‚Äô neural networks through the transmission of knowledge and learning. Listening to music that resonates within me over my lunch break helps get me pumped up. Commiserating with my coworkers sends ripples of energy, building bridges of understanding and empathy, which help us power through the day. Of course I need my dopamine fix from social media while walking the halls. These tiny sparks of energy from plebs miles away connect us while simultaneously amplifying their message. It could be said that improving our social lives is an attempt to integrate the flow of energy.Thinking more globally, we‚Äôve learned to harness natural forces and resources and have channeled that energy to improve our living standards. From fire to water to sunlight to oil, we‚Äôve understood the rhythmic patterns of seasons. While respecting nature's balance, we can see the continuous and harmonious exchange of life-giving forces within our world. We‚Äôve been able to conceptualize a method, admittedly flawed, of transmitting abstract value in the current, traditional form of money. The economy has the potential to be buzzing with activity while sparking growth and innovation in a dynamic cycle of financial exchange. Even governments redirect energy in the form of taxes and imposed morals, shaping our world in profound ways. In politics and power, every decision and policy is like a switch that redirects societal energy, influencing public opinion and behavior, a veritable tug of war over public perception. In this light, society‚Äôs goal is to iterate towards fairness of sharing energy.Bitcoin Integrates ThisBut if those analogies are valid, then how does Bitcoin fit into the concept of energy? Consider the following... Bitcoin integrates the flow of energy, maintains the storage of energy, and promotes the fairness of sharing energy.Imagine a river flowing smoothly, finding the easiest path downhill. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, acts like this river, finding the most efficient ways to transfer value and energy across the globe, bypassing traditional financial dams and obstacles. But here's the interesting part - the energy used in the mining process is not wasted. In fact, it is harnessed and put to good use. Miners often set up their operations in areas with abundant and cheap energy sources, such as hydroelectric power plants or capturing flare gas emissions. This means that the energy used to mine bitcoins is clean and sustainable, reducing the carbon footprint associated with traditional mining operations.Just like a battery stores energy, Bitcoin's limited supply and digital nature make it a reservoir for storing economic energy. Its value, derived from the energy expended in mining and the trust of its users, allows it to hold energy over time, releasing or absorbing it as the market demands. This means that individuals and businesses can use Bitcoin as a way to store their excess energy. For example, a power company can convert excess energy into bitcoins and store them for later use, effectively turning their excess energy into a valuable asset.In a world where financial systems often favor the powerful, Bitcoin emerges as a beacon of fairness. Its transparent and immutable ledger ensures that every transaction is recorded and open for verification, promoting a just and fair exchange of energy. In traditional energy systems, there is often a centralized authority that controls the distribution of energy. This can lead to inefficiencies and inequalities in the system. However, with Bitcoin, the decentralized nature of the network ensures that energy can be shared more fairly. Individuals can directly transact their economic energy with each other using Bitcoin, bypassing the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs.Bitcoin doesn't recognize borders, cultures, or biases. It unites the world under a single, universal protocol for energy exchange, allowing individuals from all corners of the globe to participate in a shared economic ecosystem. As we harness more renewable energy sources and improve our technological capabilities, Bitcoin stands ready to integrate these advances, evolving continuously to channel global energy flows more efficiently.From the sun's rays permeating our world to the electricity lighting our homes to the feeling of a warm embrace, the world can be perceived as one elaborate transfer of energy. If this is the case, shouldn't we be embracing a technology that harnesses, democratizes, and respects the flow of energy. As we embrace the future, let's recognize the role of Bitcoin in shaping a world where energy flows freely, stored securely, and shared justly, empowering us all in this ongoing odyssey of energy transformation.This is a guest post by Tim Niemeyer.

        "title": "Bitcoin Is A Database",
        "summary": "Bitcoin and every aspect of the protocol that runs it orbits around facilitating one thing: the maintenance and reconciliation of databases.",
        "content": "Get ready, brace yourself. Reading this might enrage and confound you, it might confuse you, you might even get mad enough to punch your screen (don‚Äôt do that.) Consider this a trigger warning.Bitcoin is a database. Period. That is what it is. The blockchain is a database for storing past updates to be able to reproduce the current state of that database, the UTXO set. The entire Bitcoin protocol is built around the database. What is a valid entry in that database, and what is not a valid database entry? Who is allowed to propose entries to that database, how do you ensure that only those users‚Äô entries will be considered and accepted? What is the authentication mechanism restricting writing entries to this database? How do you throttle database entries so that people can‚Äôt make so many it overloads or crashes the software managing the database? How do you ensure that people can‚Äôt make single entries that are large enough to cause other denial of service concerns? It‚Äôs all about the database. Proof-of-work? The entire purpose of that in the protocol is to manage who can actually process updates to the database. Bitcoin is meant to be a decentralized system, so it needed a way for the database to be updated in a decentralized way while still allowing users to come to consensus with all their individual copies of the database on a single update to it. If everyone is just updating their own copy of the database by themselves, there is no way everyone will come to consensus on a single version of the database. If you depend on some authority figures to handle updates, then the update process is not truly decentralized. This was the point of POW, to allow anyone to process an update, but not without incurring a verifiable cost in doing so. Proof-of-work is simply a decentralized mechanism for updating a database.The entire peer-to-peer network architecture? It exists solely to propagate proposed database update entries (transactions), and finalized database updates (blocks). Nodes verifying transactions as they enter their mempool? It‚Äôs to pre-filter proposed entry updates to the database and ensure they are valid. Nodes verifying that a block meets the required difficulty target? It‚Äôs to pre-filter a proposed database update and ensure it's valid before passing it on to other nodes to update their local copy. The peer-to-peer network exists purely to reconcile multiple copies of the same database.Bitcoin script? It literally exists for the sole purpose of functioning as an authorization mechanism for entries in the database. In order to delete an existing entry in the current database state, the UTXO set, a user proposing that update must provide authentication proof meeting the conditions of the script locking the existing database entry. Only existing entries, or UTXOs, can be ‚Äúspent‚Äù in order to authorize the creation of new entries into the database. Miners are the only ones in the protocol allowed to create entries without meeting the condition of removing an existing one by meeting the authorization requirements set out in it‚Äôs locking script. Bitcoin script is simply a mechanism to control and restrict who can write to the database. Every single aspect of what Bitcoin is revolves around the core central function of maintaining a database, and ensuring that many network participants all retaining their individual copies of that database remain in sync and agree on what the current state of the database is. All of the properties that make Bitcoin valuable as a form of money, or a means of payment, are literally derived from how it functions as a database. Many people in this space think that this database should be used solely for a means of payment, or a form of money, and I empathize with that view. I too think that is the most important use case for it, and I think that every effort should be taken in order to scale that particular use case as much as possible without sacrificing the sovereignty and security of being able to directly interact with that database yourself. But it is still just a database when you boil down to the objective reality of what Bitcoin is. People willing to pay the costs denominated in satoshis to write an entry that is considered valid under the rules of that database can do so. There is nothing you can do in order to stop them short of changing what is considered a valid entry in that database, which entails convincing everyone else to also adopt a new ruleset regarding what is a valid entry. People can freely compete within the consensus rules to write whatever they want to this database, as long as they pay the costs required of the rules and incentive structure of mining to do so. Period. Are many of the things people can and are entering into the database stupid? Yes. Of course they are. The internet is littered with mind numbing amounts of stupid things in siloed databases all over the place. Why is that? Because people are willing to pay the cost to put stupid things in a database. Whether that is users of the database paying the provider and operator, or the operator themselves allowing certain things to be entered as part of operations without passing the cost to a user, is irrelevant. These stupid things only exist somewhere in digital form because in some way, the cost is paid to do so. Bitcoin is fundamentally no different from any other database in that regard. The only difference is that there is no singular owner or gatekeeper dictating what is allowed or not. Every owner of a copy of the Bitcoin database is capable of allowing or not allowing whatever they want; the problem is if they choose to refuse something that everyone else finds acceptable, they fall out of consensus with everyone else. Their local database is no longer in sync with the global virtual database that everyone else is following and using. If you find certain database entries unacceptable, then by all means change the rules your local copy validates new entries against. But that is cutting off your nose to spite your face. At the end of the day Bitcoin runs on one simple axiom: pay to play. If people pay the fee, they get to play. That‚Äôs just how it works. At the end of the day, it is entirely up to every individual what they want to allow or not allow in their database, but cutting through all the semantics and philosophical debates going on right now one thing remains unquestionably and objectively true: Bitcoin is a database.¬†",

        "summary": "When the price starts moving people tend to act irrationally and impulsively, it's important to remember to keep your head and think with your brain.",
        "content": "We all have a journey to Bitcoin. Some started as sound money advocates who adored Austrian economics and gold. Others fell out of the TradFi world when they knew something wasn‚Äôt quite right. Most Bitcoiners have gone through trials and tribulations of altcoin hell. However you made it here and to Bitcoin, welcome‚Äìand buckle the F*ck up.When I first became interested in Bitcoin, it was July of 2017, and it was already well into the bull market of that year. I bought some and watched its value increase. Then I bought more. As tends to happen during these parabolic bull runs, I kept watching the price rise and my interest go from:Interested to Disbelief to Infatuation to Degenerate Buying to Despair.This is a trajectory you can avoid during the next bull run if you prepare yourself properly.If you are reading this hoping to find all the answers, I have some unfortunate news. There are no right answers in Bitcoin or life. We are all on a journey to figure out what to do and how to approach. I hope to guide you, but ultimately, your personal goals and disposition will dictate how you handle volatility. Bitcoin will test your resolve. During the later phase of the 2017 bull run, I talked about Bitcoin to everyone in my life‚Äîcompletely obsessed. My neighbor at the time was older than me and had experienced the dot-com boom. I will never forget the advice he gave me; this advice was born of gaining (and losing) a lot of money during the dot-com bubble. He listened to my fervent interest in Bitcoin, and he took a very measured approach to my evident LOVE for this asset. He told me that during the dot-com boom, he made more money than he ever believed he would have, and in the end, he was right back where he began‚Äîbecause he rode the bull market over the top and didn‚Äôt sell anything. His advice was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you are doing well, but don‚Äôt forget to take some profit.‚Äù He advised me to sell 50% and keep 50%‚Äîa simple hedging strategy. I did heed his advice shortly after Bitcoin hit its all-time high and sold some of my holdings near that local top.Now, I know that this is sacrilege to many hodlers. We don‚Äôt sell our bitcoin, right?? Well, that is a personal decision, and depending on your risk tolerance and place in life, you may want to take some risk off the table. That is part of investing, and as the old saying goes, no one ever loses money selling for a profit. This article aims to give the advice I wish I had gotten when I first discovered Bitcoin. I hope this helps newcomers to the space understand how to navigate the bombastic environment that bitcoin produces during its bull runs.I have seen two bull runs, one in 2017 and one in 2021. These bull runs were VERY different, and I suspect that if you spoke to those involved in bull runs prior to 2017, you would find that those also had a very different feel.The first thing I want to get off my chest is this‚ÄîNo one knows what is going to happen:Balaji talks about 1 million in 3 months Nobel laureates are saying it will go to zero Buffett and Munger(RIP) call it rat poisonWhoever you are listening to, no matter how long they have been in the space or how correct they have been in the past, IT DOES NOT MATTER. They have no idea what the future holds.In investing, there is an idea called survivorship bias. Those who have been correct have survived, and they seem like geniuses because they have been correct. The VAST majority of those who have been wrong are forgotten. You don‚Äôt hear about them. I won‚Äôt throw anyone under the bus here, but there were prominent people in Bitcoin calling for MUCH higher prices when we were sitting at 68K in 2021. I‚Äôm not saying that they are bad people; I‚Äôm sure that they had a good reason to forecast these numbers, but if you had taken their advice at that time, you would have bought at the worst time possible and gotten crushed for YEARS.In my view, there are different tiers of crystal ball holders out there, and the lowest tier is the technical analyst type. These are the dime-a-dozen people you see on Twitter spouting off about momentum, price levels, cup and handles, etc. These people were calling for 10K bitcoin when it bottomed at 16k. I‚Äôm not saying that TA is all nonsense; fundamentally, it is a system for predicting human action through probability. It‚Äôs a consideration at best. It should never be used in a vacuum to determine your allocations. If you use it in conjunction with fundamentals, it can be much more helpful. The point I am driving at here is there are GRAVEYARDS of TA analysts out there who told you to buy at 68K and not to buy at 16K. They are throwing probabilistic darts. Don‚Äôt put your financial future on someone‚Äôs educated guess.The second brand of crystal ball aficionados out there are macro analysts. These people have more credibility in my view because they are assessing the general trend in the economy. They are considering interest rates, Fed movements, and economic data. These types are MUCH closer to base reality because they have their finger on the pulse of the economic heartbeat. But, as with TA analysts, these people can be TOTALLY wrong. Many said that Fed funds rates couldn‚Äôt exceed x or y, or the entire economy would collapse. Well, the interest rates have been elevated to levels well above their doomsday predictions, and we have not seen a collapse.Whether you follow a TA analyst or a Macro analyst, they can be utterly WRONG because of a black swan. Nicholas Taleb‚Äîfamously hated by Bitcoiners‚Äîcoined the phrase black swan to label events that happen from time to time that simply cannot be predicted in standard modeling because they are so unlikely. Covid was a black swan. The war in Ukraine was a black swan. And guess what, there could be another unpredictable black swan tomorrow that could render all of the TA and macro analysts completely wrong. The world has a ton of randomness. By the way, black swans aren‚Äôt always bad. They are just as likely to be positive catalysts.So does this mean we should remain paralyzed with fear and not trust anyone??Absolutely not. It means we should make the effort to EDUCATE OURSELVES! You need to take responsibility for yourself and your decisions. You can take the information from the TA analysts and the macro analyst and make your own educated decisions. THIS IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE.Educate YourselfBitcoin is an incredibly simple yet endlessly complex animal. Your education will never be complete, but you can incrementally expand your understanding. We did a 10-episode Bitcoin Basics Series with Dazbea and Seb Bunney, and I don‚Äôt feel like we even scratched the surface!You want to be educated for resiliency. If you have a solid grasp of Bitcoin and how it works, you will not be easily shaken. The psychology here is VERY IMPORTANT. If you understand what you are investing in, and the market is hit by an exchange failure similar to what happened to FTX, you will understand a few things that the average person may not.Bitcoin is unaffected The price drop is temporary and without merit Therefore, this is a great time to be accumulating BitcoinNow, the opposite of this is also true. When you see mainstream headlines fawning over Bitcoin, with the gains never seeming to end, and you feel like you should drop every bit of money into Bitcoin because its price is going nowhere but up‚ÄîBE CAUTIOUS. I have found that my psychology is typical. I have fear when the price is getting crushed, and I have irrational exuberance when the price is rising quickly. If I do EXACTLY the opposite of what my monkey brain tells me, I find I‚Äôm often doing the right thing. That is to say, when you feel extreme fear, this is the time to buy, and when you feel elated, this is the time to sell.Panic buying is dangerous. When you feel an uncontrollable urge to buy Bitcoin, take a deep breath. I can assure you that you will be able to buy some, and if you are feeling the urge this strongly, the market is probably ripe for a pullback. That is no guarantee, but in my experience, this has been the likely case. I am not advocating for trading BTC, not at all. I can honestly say that I have lost more BTC than I have gained by trading, and if most people are honest, they will admit the same. Trading is a skill and discipline that very few people master.The typical psychological roadblocks that hang people up are fear and greed. Reflect on your feelings and recognize when you are experiencing these emotions. They will cause you to make mistakes. The simplest way to mitigate all of this is simply to dollar-cost average. Swan is the PERFECT place for DCA. Dollar-cost averaging takes all the stress out. Full stop. If you level into this asset at this moment and it drops to 30% overnight, ask yourself honestly: Do I have the stomach for that? Do I have the conviction for that? Do I have the educational chops to understand why the dollar price doesn‚Äôt matter in the short term? Will I panic sell? If you aren‚Äôt convicted, dollar-cost averaging will save you. You are getting the average price over a long period of time.I have a little DCA tactic that is simple and works for me:When the price corrects I increase my DCA, when the price gets frothy, I feather back and average in with less. Over months and years, this supercharges your average buy.Don‚Äôt Feel Like A Sellout For Selling BTCHave a plan and be ready to execute. My neighbor's plan is a solid place to start. Once you have doubled your money, take the initial investment out. There is a significant asterisk involved in this‚ÄîWhat are you going to buy instead of Bitcoin? Inflating cash? The choices for where else you put your money these days are very limited. This might be controversial to many in the space, but I think it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to sell some Bitcoin. If you have been holding for YEARS, and your stack could meaningfully make your life better, by all means, sell a portion.Time is the one asset that is more valuable than BTC; we have a truly finite amount of time on this earth. If you hodl your BTC and then take a dirt nap, what was the point? If you can sell a portion of your stack and pay off your house, or get out of crushing debt, I think that is a sound decision. It may not be the BEST financial decision, especially if your house is on a low-interest rate loan, but it‚Äôs an understandable decision because of the peace of mind this could bring. However, you must also remember that selling Bitcoin will very likely be a painful decision in the long term.Selling Bitcoin for toys on the other hand is not a great move. When you buy that 250k moon Lamborghini, which loses 50% of its value in 3 years while Bitcoin has gained more than that percentage to the upside, the regret will be unbearable. Robert Kiyosaki comes to mind. His book Rich Dad Poor Dad has been very influential on me, and his description of assets vs. liabilities hit home:An asset generates cash flow A liability subtracts cash flowIf you buy assets, your net worth will increase substantially on an exponential curve. If you are buying liabilities, you are simply getting poorer. If you sell Bitcoin, you will likely regret it in the long term.Time PreferenceTime preference is a topic often visited in Bitcoin. Having a low time preference means you are willing to forgo niceties today for a better future. Every worthwhile cathedral, every classic piece of art, everything beautiful in this world has been built because people worked with an eye to the future, not the present. If DaVinci taped bananas to the wall we would have never remembered him. If the great pyramids had been built of clay, they would be gone. If Civilization spent all of its wealth on the here and now without investing in the future it would not last.Bitcoin itself is a digital artifact that has been crafted to perfection by a mysterious architect. It is designed to last eons; if civilization lasts, it will have perfect fidelity into the future. Because no one can change it or control it, Bitcoin is anti-entropic. This is the epitome of low-time preference craftsmanship. Bitcoin is a Da Vinci in a world of bananas taped to walls. It's so apparent once the work is put in that it‚Äôs embarrassing more people don‚Äôt understand the value proposition.In stark contrast to this Bitcoin masterpiece, we have the sand hills we call alt-coins or shitcoins. These have been built using Bitcoin's technology but introducing entropy. Fidelity is lost in altcoins because each has a founder or group who controls them. When humans can control something, they inevitably manipulate it to their benefit. And whether consciously or subconsciously, it will degrade. Most of these shitcoins have been designed from the outset to scam you. Some of these alt-coins have leadership that may be well-intentioned, but they are human and capable of being influenced and coerced. The problem is LEADERSHIP. Bitcoin and its time chain have been designed to remove the human element as a primary characteristic. Introducing humans into the mix causes entropy to destroy value through seigniorage.Bitcoin's invention was that of NON-INTERVENTION by humans.These are insights that take years for many people to understand completely. If you want the TL;DR on altcoins, it‚Äôs simple. Just don‚Äôt bother. You are better off taking your money to a casino and playing craps. The deck is stacked heavily against you in the crypto world; you are simply getting lucky if you make money. Take the low-time preference route and stack Bitcoin while learning as your investment grows. I can confidently say that you will be much further ahead in 5 years dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin than you will be gambling on shitcoins.5-Year Outlook MinimumMost people get interested in Bitcoin during one of its parabolic bull runs. I was one of them. We are all interested in getting ahead financially, especially with the specter of inflation hanging over our heads.If you are new to Bitcoin and this is your first foray, make sure you are prepared to hold this asset for a minimum of 5 years. You are likely here during a bull run, and unless you got lucky, it‚Äôs probably on the trailing end of the bull run. As of the date of writing in December 2023, I believe we are at the beginning of the next bull market. With the ETF approval, the halving in April 2024, and the Fed poised to turn dovish, many catalysts are aligned. This does NOT make it inevitable. Black swans are always a possibility. With that black swan caveat aside, we seem poised for massive price appreciation in the next few years.Self CustodyThe first time you buy Bitcoin at the exchange of your choice, it will feel like buying any other asset at a brokerage. You buy Bitcoin, and the number on the screen reflects the amount of bitcoin you now ‚Äúown.‚ÄùIt is critically important that you take custody of your Bitcoin. We have seen exchange failure and downright fraud go on very recently. When these frauds are uncovered and prosecuted and the price of Bitcoin gets hammered because many people associate the asset Bitcoin with the exchanges that sell it, this becomes a HUGE buying opportunity. When FTX failed 1 year ago, the price of Bitcoin was negatively affected, and those who understood that Bitcoin had no fundamental problem loaded up. They understood that fear was coursing its way through the market (back to why being educated is SO IMPORTANT in this space). If you bought Bitcoin at that time (around 16k), you secured well over a 100% gain in a year!Think of seed keys as the password to your Bitcoin, which must be protected because if anyone else gets it, they can take possession of your Bitcoin‚Äîno bueno. Bitcoin Seed keys are generally protected by a hardware wallet or signing device. This device protects your seed keys from hackers or bad actors. I have been using Coldcards for years, and they are some of the best devices for protecting seed keys. It works very simply. You create your secret keys using the device; it saves them and keeps them offline, never connected to the internet. That last point is IMPORTANT. You do not EVER want to save these words on an internet-connected computer. The only place to safely store your Seed Keys is on a device designed for them. If the computer is compromised (and believe me, it is VERY LIKELY COMPROMISED) the signing device will protect your Bitcoin.This may all sound very difficult and complex if you have never done it before, but trust me, it‚Äôs easy. I would recommend that you watch BTC Sessions videos about using the signing device you choose. He has incredible walk-through videos on YouTube that explain how to do everything in detail.Collaborative custody with a company like Swan Bitcoin or Unchained Capital is also a good idea for those new to the space. They will hold your hand and protect you from making simple mistakes that can cause issues. Collaborative custody is worth the cost if you are worried about losing your Bitcoin. Unchained offers a collaborative custody product that can hold multiple keys and can help your relatives retrieve your Bitcoin in the case of your demise.DO NOT BRAG ABOUT YOUR BITCOIN. There is a temptation to brag about success. If you stay the course for five years, you will likely have it. You are proud that you have had the discipline and self-control to master yourself and successfully acquire what you view as a significant amount of Bitcoin. Don‚Äôt share how much you have with others. This should be obvious, but there are people that may not be so excited for you. They may tell their friends, and sooner or later someone who you don‚Äôt know, who may have the capacity for violence, may decide you are an appetizing target. This is yet another reason to use a multi-sig setup. Even if someone obtained 1 of 3 keys, they cannot steal your Bitcoin.Don‚Äôt Buy Bitcoin That You Don‚Äôt ControlDon‚Äôt purchase the shiny new ETF Wall Street is offering. Buy Bitcoin only at places that allow you to take actual custody of your Bitcoin. Don‚Äôt put your Bitcoin on any kind of service that offers a yield, especially if that yield seems unrealistically high. As a general rule of thumb, just don‚Äôt do it.The first and most important reason you should take custody of your Bitcoin is that you have absolute and complete control of it. There is a saying in Bitcoin, ‚Äúnot your keys, not your coins.‚Äù If you do not have custody of your Bitcoin, you simply have an IOU. This is the entire reason for Bitcoin‚Äôs existence. To remove middlemen and allow people to control their financial destiny.When you have custody, you do not incur a fee like you would with an ETF. These fees can seem low, but over time they can be SIGNIFICANT. GBTC is a trust that is the most similar to a Bitcoin ETF. GBTC charges a 2% fee PER YEAR (now 1.5% with the ETF). Over time this can be significant. Additionally, the ETF products that Wall Street is selling don‚Äôt allow you to EVER custody the bitcoin. An ETF could make sense for some people in some scenarios, but for anyone who can confidently build a Lego set, taking custody of Bitcoin is of similar complexity. Just do it yourself.As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, it will be possible to use it as collateral. Yes, I understand that using your Bitcoin as collateral takes it out of your possession and requires trust in a 3rd party. This is another case where you should educate yourself and be SURE that you have chosen a lender that is trustworthy and will not go bust. Always defer to self-custody if in any doubt.Borrowing against your Bitcoin is impossible if you don‚Äôt have custody of it yourself. You cannot lend the Bitcoin that Blackrock is holding on your behalf. This is significant. There are tax benefits from borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it. If you don‚Äôt control your Bitcoin, you are boxing yourself out of some predictable use cases in the near future and many unpredictable uses that have yet to be invented. Programmable money is not useful if you don‚Äôt have custody of it. The final reason you should hold your Bitcoin is a bit darker. Bitcoin was designed to be uncensorable and unconfiscatable. When it becomes apparent to the state that it is losing control of the money, it will likely come for yours. This has precedent in U.S. history. In 1933, Executive Order 6102 made it illegal to own gold for U.S. citizens. They compelled people to turn in gold and receive $20 per ounce. The government then repriced gold at $35 per ounce. You could get jailed for owning gold coins in the U.S. from 1933 until the mid-1970s. This could happen again, and you have optionality if you hold Bitcoin yourself. Custodians WILL be compelled to give the government your Bitcoin in this scenario. What you do with your Bitcoin in this situation should be YOUR call, not a custodian‚Äôs.ResponsibilityIf you take the steps to self-custody your bitcoin, you are responsible. This is a type of radical responsibility that can worry people. If you lose your seed keys, your Bitcoin is lost forever. There is no number to call, and no one who can help you. IT. IS. GONE.In 2017, one of my friends at the firehouse lost what was then $1300 worth of bitcoin because he put the Bitcoin on a paper wallet. These aren‚Äôt used anymore because they are so insecure, but you can print out a QR code that will hold your bitcoin. He left the piece of paper in his car. He then cleaned out his car and vacuumed up the paper wallet. That Bitcoin is gone forever. It is now worth somewhere in the range of 4-5 thousand dollars, and it's just gone. Well, it's technically not gone, it's still there; just not accessible to anyone. Without the password, no one can move the bitcoin, so it‚Äôs effectively bitcoin that is frozen forever.Another good friend of mine lost a significant amount of Bitcoin at a company called BlockFi. This was an exchange that offered yield on Bitcoin kept at their exchange. That Bitcoin is not frozen, but it is now locked up in litigation for the foreseeable future. To add insult to injury‚Äîbecause the Bitcoin when held by BlockFi was not technically his, it is theirs based on the ‚Äúagreement‚Äù he signed when opening the account, he will at some future date get the dollar value of that bitcoin at the price when BlockFi went bust‚Äîwhich is 16 thousand dollars‚Äîwe have rounded squarely back to why you should take self-custody seriously!The old saying in bitcoin is ‚ÄúNot your keys, not your Coins.‚ÄùBitcoin is an endless learning journey. If you want a rabbit hole to explore, you are in luck! The amount of solid content offered in the space is light-years better than in 2017. You can go from zero to proficient in a fraction of the time it would have taken back then. As was alluded to above a couple times, we have curated a Basics Series at Blue Collar Bitcoin that you can use to get started. The list of great content creators and resources is so long that we can‚Äôt name them all. Just go exploring and be careful to verify, not trust.Continue learning, and above all‚Äîthink for yourself!Remember the wisdom of Matt Odell: ‚ÄúStay humble and stack Sats.‚ÄùThis is a guest post by Josh.

        "content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now.\n\nThis week‚Äôs topicsMonumental SEC failureBitcoin ETF multipleGerman economic updateTaiwan elections and China responseSEC‚Äôs 2FA FailureBitcoin is a great teacher. Many of us have learned so much, from studying and following Bitcoin over the years, not just about money but about life. Once again, Bitcoin provides us with a teachable moment in the hack of the SEC‚Äôs X/Twitter account. First, even if you are a normie in favor of heavily regulated markets, this event should open your eyes to the fact that the regulators have grown into a systemic risk themselves. They are a risk to the investors they are supposed to protect. The SEC is even in a battle at the Supreme Court battle over their in-house semi-judicial system.Secondly, this scandal happened because the SEC didn‚Äôt use 2FA, months after warning everyone about the use of 2FA. This shocking incompetence might wake many out there and spread the use of 2FA ‚Äî something long overdue.The total damage based on the SEC‚Äôs failure was $30 billion wiped from the market cap with $90 million worth of open positions liquidated. Of course, the SEC did not apologize for their failure and will likely be facing legal consequences. Spicy take, this bitcoin-inspired scandal might result not only in us getting the ETFs approved, but also the SEC getting taken down a peg.\n\nBitcoin Market Cap Multiple of InflowsEstimates of inflows on the bitcoin ETF‚Äôs first days of trading are expected to be massive. Issuers have publicly stated they are seeding their funds with $312.9 million so far. These are commitments by private players to immediately create shares to seed liquidity. This does not include other money from regular trading. The fee structures submitted this week by issuers have clauses for introductory periods based on the inflow of assets under management. For example, ARK is offering a 0.0% management fee for the first 6 months or until $1 billion in AUM. Invesco is offering 0.0% for 6 months or $5 billion AUM. This means they expect those time periods and AUM to be a practical expectation. If we add up all these special fees discounts, we arrive at $13 billion of expected AUM growth in the first 6-12 months from 5 issuers alone. That does not mean inflows exactly because bitcoin bought earlier will appreciate adding to AUM.\n\nSource: @JSeyffThe seeding funds are small potatoes compared to the total $25 trillion AUM of the issuers. If 1% were to come into the bitcoin ETFs over the first 12 months, that is $250 billion.Back in 2021, near the ATH, Bank of America put out a study that bitcoin had a 118x multiplier on inflow to market cap appreciation. So, for every $1 million in fresh buying, the market cap would increase by $118 million. That multiplier relies on many different factors, like speed of inflow, number of available bitcoin on exchanges, and block reward. Bank of America made their estimate when there were 2.7 million BTC on exchanges, today there are only 1.8 million ‚Äî or 607,000 when considering the major US exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken only. In other words, the multiplier could be greater than 118x this time.The largest single ETF launch in history saw $2 billion of inflows. The bitcoin ETF event promises to be bigger than that because it is a group of 11 ETFs and is a new asset class. $2 billion is therefore conservative, but we‚Äôll use it for our purposes here. $2 billion times 118 means $236 billion market appreciation on day one. The market cap at time of writing is $900 billion, meaning the first day move could be ~25%, taking us to $58,000.\n\nGerman De-industrializationPeople think it can‚Äôt happen, that‚Äôs why it is happening. Some Germans are beginning to understand the effect of deglobalization on their economic model, and the effect that communist climate policies will have on heavy industry. Large companies like BASF, Linde, and Volkswagen all have plans to move out of Germany. Energy-intensive industrial production is being hit the worst. 2024 is going to be a massive recessionary year around the world.\n\nSource: Financial TimesThe latest number for November showed the sixth straight month of industrial production, the worst stretch since the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nSource: @SoberLookTaiwan Elections and China‚Äôs Economic DisasterOne of the most consequential elections this year is happening Saturday in Taiwan. As it stands, it is a three-way race for president with the more anti-China Democratic Progressive Party, Lai Ching-te, as the front-runner. He is friendly to the US and will be a thorn in the side of the CCP. Certainly, China has invested heavily in stopping him and spreading propaganda within Taiwan. Despite this, the anti-China candidate is still favored.\n\nSource: NHK Japan Broadcasting Corporation\n\nSource: Fulcrum Asset ManagementThis election has global consequences as you can imagine. In an article yesterday on Bloomberg, they highlighted the possibility that the election of Lai could lead directly to conflict with China and potentially cost the global economy $10 trillion.This is also happening as the Chinese economy is falling apart. Their blue-chip stock market CSI 300, recently hit 5-year lows, standing in stark contrast to the US stock markets rallying to near ATHs. \n\nSource: Yahoo FinanceLast but not least, the foreign direct investment (FDI) numbers for 2023 have come out and they are a total disaster. Money is fleeing China at the fastest pace in modern history. All this is to say that the election in Taiwan and the economic pressures in China could move the world closer to conflict over Taiwan.Source: @Geo_papic",

Because of this, we‚Äôve changed a few items:\n\nWe are using Last Price marking because there is not yet an observable price for ZETA.\nTo protect the market against manipulation, we will use Limit Up and Limit Down prices, which are set each hour, on the hour, at Mark Price +/- 20%.

        "content": "\nOffered to our top traders, we‚Äôre excited to introduce Margin+,¬† a collateral support programme designed to let you trade more, without needing to fund your accounts with your own capital.\nIt‚Äôs a move we‚Äôre making so that you can take your PnL gains to the next level ‚Äì by allowing you to take more/larger positions as well as place more/larger orders.\nSome traders may have already received an exclusive invitation to join the new programme as a result of being a top trader. Interested in finding out more about Margin+? Want to know how to get involved? Read on.\nIf you haven‚Äôt signed up for a BitMEX account yet, we‚Äôre currently offering 5,000 USD worth of BMEX Tokens to new users ‚Äì you can register here.\nWhat is the Margin+ Programme?\nBitMEX traders that join Margin+ will receive extra collateral in Tether (USDT) or Bitcoin (XBT) to trade more effectively on our platform.\nWho is Margin+ Made For?\nThe Margin+ programme was designed to reward BitMEX‚Äôs top traders and communities. It‚Äôs a way to trade more without having to fund your accounts with extra capital out of your pocket.\nThe programme is best suited to non-directional traders whose strategies do not involve taking highly leveraged positions.\nAs Margin+ has strict trading volume and balance requirements, we advise you to carefully evaluate your need for the programme before reaching out.¬†\nHow Does the Margin+ Programme Work?\nThose already eligible for the Margin+ Programme will be able to locate a Margin+ tab in their BitMEX trading menu. Applications can be submitted via the portal they are led to.¬†\nBitMEX will then review applications and provide applicants with an update within 72 hours. If your application is approved, you‚Äôll have your Margin+ funds credited to your BitMEX account shortly after, as long as you meet the minimum balance requirements.¬†\nOnce you‚Äôre in the programme, you must meet the defined trading obligations ‚Äì otherwise an extension fee will be charged at the end of each month.\nTo avoid margin call and liquidation, you must maintain a Minimum Balance, as well as limits on your account‚Äôs overall leverage via the Maintenance Margin Ratio.\nMinimum Balance\nMinimum collateral balance refers to the wallet balance in your BitMEX account.\nBefore getting started with Margin+, you must hold 30% of the collateral value before BitMEX proceeds to drawdown. Otherwise, a margin call shortly after drawdown is possible.¬†\nAfter your Margin+ is activated, your Minimum Balance must remain above 125% of the collateral value to avoid a margin call. Liquidation will occur if one of the following scenarios occurs:¬†\n\nYou‚Äôre in margin call for more than 12 hours;\nYour Minimum Balance ever drops below 110% of the collateral value.\n\nShow Me An Example of How the Minimum Balance Requirement Works\nLet‚Äôs say Joe applies for a Margin+ of 10,000 Tether (USDT).¬†\n\nTo proceed to drawdown, Joe needs to have a minimum of 3,000 USDT (or XBT equivalent) in his wallet.\nTo avoid margin call, Joe needs to have a minimum of 12,500 USDT (or XBT equivalent) in his wallet.\nTo avoid liquidation, Joe needs to have a minimum of 11,000 USDT (or XBT equivalent) in his wallet.¬†\n\nMaintenance Margin Ratio\nMaintenance Margin Ratio is calculated as: Available Funds/Maintenance Margin Requirement (MMR). Simply put, the Maintenance Margin Ratio controls how much leverage you can take in an active Margin+ agreement.\nA lower ratio means you have less available funds to cover the MMR tied to your open positions ‚Äì meaning you are more leveraged. On the other hand, a higher ratio means you have more available funds to cover the MMR and hence are less leveraged.\nWhen getting started with Margin+, you must have a Maintenance Margin Ratio of 12 or above for BitMEX to process the funds‚Äô drawdown. This protects Margin+ users from hitting margin call shortly after their drawdown.\nAfter your Margin+ is activated, you must ensure your Maintenance Margin Ratio remains above 10. A margin call will occur if your Maintenance Margin Ratio remains below 10 for 12 hours or immediately after the ratio drops below 5.\nShow Me An Example of How the Minimum Margin Ratio Works\nLet‚Äôs say Joe has two open positions: a long position on the XBTUSDT contract and a long position on the ETHUSDT contract.¬†\n\nJoe holds a long position of 0.1 XBT on XBTUSDT (isolated 5x) at 45,000. The maintenance margin requirement for this is 10%, which is 450 USDT.¬†\nJoe holds a long position of 1 ETH on ETHUSDT (isolated 10x) at 2,300. The maintenance margin requirement for this is 5%, which is 115 USDT.¬†\nAssume Joe has 5,000 USDT as margin balance. His Maintenance Margin Ratio is calculated as: Margin Balance/(XBTUSDT Margin Requirement + ETHUSDT Margin Requirement) = 5,000/(450+115).\nHis Maintenance Margin Ratio is 8.8.\n\n\nIn this scenario, Joe‚Äôs Maintenance Margin Ratio is below 10 ‚Äì meaning he will be in margin call. Here, he has three options to remedy the situation:¬†\n1) Add more funds to his account;\n2) Close his positions;\n3) Cancel his open orders.¬†\nLet‚Äôs say Joe opts for option one and decides to fund his account with an extra 2,000 USDT.¬†\n\nJoe now has 7,000 USDT as margin balance. His Maintenance Margin Ratio is calculated as: Margin Balance/(XBTUSDT Margin Requirement + ETHUSDT Margin Requirement) = 7,000/(450+115).\nHis Maintenance Margin Ratio is 12.4.\n\nJoe‚Äôs Maintenance Margin Ratio is now above 10 ‚Äì meaning he will no longer be in margin call.¬†\n\nHow Do I Keep Track of My Margin+ Requirements?\nTo best support users of Margin+, those in the programme get access to an exclusive dashboard that helps you keep track of your account‚Äôs‚Ä¶\n\nMinimum Balance¬†\nMaintenance Margin Ratio\nMinimum Trading Volume¬†\n\nThe dashboard can be found in the dropdown menu when hovering over your account icon on the top right corner of the trading UI.¬†\n\nTo make it even more accessible, you can add a Margin+ widget directly to your Trading UI where you can see your Margin+ data in one place.¬†\n\nSounds like the right fit for you?

        "summary": "In this edition of CTD, Arthur explains why the Fed needs a mini-financial crisis - and how Bitcoin's price is a warning signal. \nThe post Yellen Or Talkin‚Äô appeared first on BitMEX Blog.",
        "content": "\n(Any views expressed in the below are the personal views of the author and should not form the basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation or advice to engage in investment transactions.)\n¬†\nUS Treasury Secretary Bad Gurl Janet Yellen and her simp cuck towel boy US Federal Reserve Chairperson Jerome Powell oscillate between decisive action and vague talking points. When they act, you best not fight them. But when they just talk, watch out because many market signals will point you down a path to sure losses.\nOn November 1st, 2023, Janet was Yellen. Included in the US Treasury‚Äôs quarterly refunding announcement (QRA) was a proclamation that she would shift the majority of borrowing to Treasury bills (T-bills), which are sub-one year in maturity. This enticed money market funds (MMF) to pull money out of the Fed‚Äôs Reverse Repo Program (RRP) and invest in higher-yielding T-bills. The result, described in detail in my essay ‚ÄúBad Gurl‚Äù, was and is providing a liquidity injection that will total close to $1 trillion once it is completed.\nIn mid-December 2024, during the FOMC press conference, Powell proclaimed that the governors were now discussing rate cuts in 2024. This was a dramatic pivot from his rhetoric two weeks prior, where he assured the markets the Fed would stay tight in order to ensure inflation did not return. The market took this to mean the first rate cut of this Fed hiking cycle would occur in March of this year. Subsequently, earlier this month, Dallas Fed governor Logan threw out a trial balloon that the pace of Quantitative Tightening (QT) would be tapered as and when RRP balances approached zero. The rationale was that the Fed did not want any dollar liquidity hiccups when one source of money printing ceased.\nLet‚Äôs recap what is just talk versus what actions have actually been taken. Yellen acted by shifting her department‚Äôs borrowing to T-bills, thus adding hundreds of billions of dollars‚Äô worth of liquidity so far. That is actual money being pumped into the global financial markets. Powell and other Fed governors talked a big game about rate cuts and tapering the pace of QT in some distant future. This talk hasn‚Äôt produced any increase in monetary stimulus. However, the market equated the actions and talk as the same thing and rallied after November 1st, continuing to rise throughout this month.¬†\nThe market I‚Äôm referring to is the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, which both hit new all-time highs. But all is not well. The real smoke alarm for the direction of dollar liquidity, Bitcoin, is throwing a cautionary sign. After the US spot ETF launch, Bitcoin has sagged from a high of $48,000 to below $40,000. Coinciding with Bitcoin‚Äôs local high, the 2-year US Treasury yield hit a local low of 4.14% in mid-January and is now marching upwards.\nThe first argument for Bitcoin‚Äôs recent dump is the outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). That argument is bogus because when you net the outflows from GBTC against the inflows into the newly listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, the result is, as of January 22nd, a net inflow of $820 million.¬†\nThe second argument, which is my position, is that Bitcoin is anticipating the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) will not be renewed. This event will not be positive as the Fed still has yet to cut rates to a level that pushes the 10-year Treasury into the 2% to 3% range. At these levels, the non-Too-Big-to-Fail (TBTF) banks‚Äô bond portfolios are back in a profit vs. the current massive unrealised loss nursed on their balance sheets. Until rates are reduced to the aforementioned levels, there is no way these banks can survive without the government support provided via the BTFP. The financial markets‚Äô buoyancy gives Yellen and Powell a false sense of confidence that the market won‚Äôt bankrupt a few non-TBTF banks once the BTFP isn‚Äôt renewed. Therefore, they believe they can stop the BTFP, which is politically toxic, and there will be no negative market reaction. However, I believe the exact opposite: the cessation of the BTFP will cause a mini-financial crisis and force the Fed to stop Talkin‚Äô and start Yellen with a rate cut, tapering of QT, and/or a resumption of money printing via quantitative easing (QE). Bitcoin‚Äôs price action tells me I‚Äôm right and they are wrong.\nThe Fed would rather just jawbone the markets with speeches and Wall Street Journal op-eds because they are deathly afraid of inflation. The war-mongering muppets in charge of Pax Americana‚Äôs foreign policy have now bungled their way into another Middle Eastern war with no end against the Yemen Houthis. Later in this essay, I will expand on why this war in the Red Sea is important, and could lead to an uncomfortable spike in goods inflation just in time for the US elections in November this year.¬†\nContrary to what the mainstream financial Western press tells you, inflation is still a problem for the majority of broke-ass Americans. Voters decide the President based on the economy, and right now, US President and Vegetable in Chief Joe Biden and his woke Democrats are slated to get smoked by the Orange Man Trump and his deplorable Republicans.\nAs I wrote in my essay, ‚ÄúSignposts,‚Äù I believe Bitcoin will dip before the BTFP renewal decision on March 12th. I didn‚Äôt expect it to happen so soon, but I think Bitcoin will find a local bottom between $30,000 and $35,000. As the SPX and NDX dump due to a mini financial crisis in March, Bitcoin will rise as it will front-run the eventual conversion of rate cuts and money printing talk on behalf of the Fed into the action of pressing that Brrrr button.\nI will now step through some charts to quickly bring readers up to speed on why I believe the Fed needs a mini-financial crisis in order to stop Talkin‚Äô and start Yellen.\nChart Porn\n\nThis is a chart of USD liquidity. To understand how this index is constructed, please read ‚ÄúTeach Me Daddy‚Äù. As the Fed started its rate hike and QT campaign in March 2022, the index crashed. However, due to the RRP falling since June of 2023, the index is back at levels not seen since April of 2022.\n\nThis chart is a subcomponent of the index, which is the net of RRP and TGA balance changes. Since the US government passed its budget in June 2023, almost $800 billion of liquidity has been added.¬†\nAt a macro level, risk assets are pumping ‚Äì despite the $1.2 trillion reduction in the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet ‚Äì due to the relatively high levels of dollar liquidity.\n\n1st Crisis\nIf we drill down to the non-TBTF insolvent banks, we see that Yellen and Powell were forced to act in order to bail out the US banking sector. The above chart is the S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) in white vs. the 2-yr Treasury yield in yellow. The banks in this index are the runts of the system as they do not enjoy a government deposit guarantee like their more prominent and profitable TBTF brethren. The sharp rise in yields in Q1 of 2023 caused the KRE to plummet as three major non-TBTF banks (Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley Bank) went bust within fortnight. Yields crashed as the market knew the Fed would have to print money to save the system, which they did via the BTFP.¬†\n2nd Crisis\nAll was good for a time, but the market started focusing on the runaway US deficit and the gargantuan amount of bonds that must be issued to finance it. Compounding this problem was Powell‚Äôs statements at the September 2023 FOMC press conference, where he said the financial markets would do the monetary tightening work for the Fed. The bond market wanted the Fed to fight inflation and make government borrowing more expensive by raising rates even more and not just chilling watching their Bloomberg terminals. Rates across the curve rose, and most worryingly, long-end rates rose in a bear-steepening fashion. I detailed why this is deadly for the financial system in my essay ‚ÄúThe Periphery.‚Äù KRE responded by dumping to levels not seen since the height of the banking crisis in April. Yellen was forced to act in November by shifting borrowing into T-bills. This saved the bond markets and caused a vicious short-covering rally in stocks and bonds.\nHopium\nThe market is now forecasting when RRP balances will reach near zero and wondering what is next. There is a lot of talk about this, including speculation about how the Fed can add liquidity without calling it money printing. But there has yet to be any action taken. The 2-year yields are marching back higher, but the KRE continues rising. The market is trading on hopium. If Yellen and Powell say the right things, 10-year yields will magically fall from 3% to 2%. Without fresh dollars buying bonds, that ain‚Äôt happening. This is the disconnect between the story the 2-year yield tells vs. the KRE. I believe the market is in for a nasty surprise as it becomes clear Powell is all bark and no bite.\n\nThis busy chart shows the divergence between Bitcoin (white) and the 2-year Treasury yield (green), which tell the same story, and the SPX (yellow), which tells a different one. As 2-year yields fell from November 1st, 2023, Bitcoin and the SPX rallied. Once the 2-yr yield bottomed and reversed direction, Bitcoin fell, and the SPX continued rising.\nBitcoin is telling the world that the Fed is trapped between inflation and a banking crisis. The Fed‚Äôs solution is to attempt to talk the market into believing the banks are sound without providing the requisite money to make that fantasy a reality.\nBroke Ass Plebes\nJim Bianco produces some excellent charts which I will lean heavily on throughout the rest of this essay.\nAs readers know, I spend northern hemispheric winters in Hokkaido, Japan. One noticeable change this season is the sheer number of Americans. Travelling to this powder heaven is a pain in the ass, even for someone who lives in Asia. It‚Äôs even more time-consuming and expensive if you live in the US. And yet, there are noticeably more US boomers skiing at the resorts. Boomers are the richest they have ever been in their lives. That is because the stock market and housing prices are at all-time highs. Also, their cash stash is yielding something for the first time in a few decades. For a cohort of humans who just saw life flash between their eyes during COVID (remember, the flu kills predominantly old fat people, aka boomers), now is the time to travel the world.\n\nThe top 10% of US households own ~65% of all the financial assets that the Fed pumps via its various money printing programs. Boomers are the wealthiest generation, and their spending is powering a very strong US economy.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed estimates 4Q2023 GDP growth will clock in at a strong +2.4%- strong to very strong!\nHowever, the rest of America is broke as fuck, and drowning in debt.\n\nThe top 10% holds ~65% of all financial assets but only ~8% of the debt. The bottom 90% holds 92% of the debt but only 35% of the assets. This highly unequal distribution of wealth and debt presents a problem for a politician in a democracy. While the politicians endeavour with great resolve to do all in their power to make the rich richer, they need to get elected by garnering support from the broke plebes. This is why when inflation shows up, it‚Äôs a problem.\nThe current Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculation methodology is Fugazi. If we go back to the 1980 or 1990 CPI calculation methodology, the actual rate of inflation is around +10% vs. the +3% rate you read in the news.\n\nAnd this is why, according to the most recent polls, Trump is a slight favourite to beat Biden.\n\nUS politics, in a nutshell, is a circus whereby the rich buy ads to raise awareness for their favourite clown, who in turn dances and sings for the votes of the plebes. Biden must hand out goodies to the rich and the poor alike to win. At a cynical macro level, the strategy is to pump the stock market owned by the rich, thereby increasing tax receipts, and then provide handouts to the poor paid for out of the loot collected from the rich.\n\nThe top 10% pay 74% of all income taxes. Their disproportionately large contribution stems from the huge sums the government collects in capital gains taxes earned during a rising stock market. As a result, the American government‚Äôs finances are tied to the stock market‚Äôs performance.\nBiden has two financial generals with different missions. Yellen must use the US Treasury‚Äôs powers to pump the stock market. She can do this by adjusting the US Treasury‚Äôs bond issuance schedule or running down the TGA. Powell must reduce inflation to an acceptable level. He can do this by raising rates and reducing the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet.\nYellen‚Äôs job is much easier than Powell‚Äôs. Yellen can unilaterally pump the stock market by issuing more T-bills and bonds, or by running the TGA from the current $750 billion to zero. Powell can reduce the money supply and raise rates, but there are geopolitical issues that he has zero control over. He also cannot influence the size of the government deficit or surplus. Suppose the government is committed to running massive deficits that Yellen will duly fund, increasing the demand for goods and services. In that case, Powell‚Äôs inflation-fighting actions at the Fed would be neutered.\nThe post-COVID bout of US inflation was so pronounced because the government handed out stimmies to the plebes that were financed by Fed money printing at a time when it was difficult to ship goods globally. There were work stoppages and labour shortages driven by COVID lockdown and vaccine policies. The result was levels of inflation not seen since the late 1970‚Äôs and early 1980‚Äôs.\nA similar global supply chain crisis is unfolding, but this time, the difficulty in shipping goods is driven by El Ni√±o and the closure of the Bab el-Mandeb to Western vessels.\nOf Horns and Hope\n \nShipping is an old but essential business. The cost per kilometre travelled is cheapest by sea vs. rail, road, or air. Without the Panama Canals or passage through the Bab el-Mandeb, ships must travel around Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope. The onset of the El Ni√±o weather pattern has caused drought conditions at the Panama Canal, resulting in lower-than-average water levels inside the canal, which means fewer ships can transit. The Yemeni Houthis‚Äô asymmetric drone warfare has effectively closed the Bab el-Mandeb for Western ships. They must now sail around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nThis rerouting affects 20% to 30% of all shipping globally and adds considerable time and expense. For an inflation statistician, anything that travels by ship will get more expensive, all else being equal. Given that inflation operates at a considerable lag, if this situation persists, the effects will only appear many months from now. While the markets are cheering YoY inflation statistics falling in the US and elsewhere, it might be a pyrrhic victory.\n¬†\n\nThe El Ni√±o weather pattern is just getting started. A mild El Ni√±o typically lasts for one to two years. However severe this El Ni√±o is, it will still be present in November of this year. Sadly, if you are a Biden supporter, he can do nothing about the weather. Humans are not even a Kardashev Type I civilization. El Ni√±o and climate change in general have lowered the Panama Canal‚Äôs water levels, reducing the number of ships that can transit.\nReducing shipping activity through the Panama Canal is important because the US was rerouting some goods through Europe to Eastern seaboard ports to avoid the canal. But, given that goods from Asia to Europe loaded on Western ships must now travel around Africa rather than through the Red Sea, delivery costs and time will increase.\n¬†\n\n\n\nThe Houthis have declared they will attack any ship of any nation that supports Israel. They believe Israel‚Äôs Gaza war is a genocidal exercise that is being prosecuted by war criminals such as Israeli Prime Minister ‚ÄúBibi‚Äù Netanyahu. In solidarity with their Muslim and Arab kin, they are using $2,000 drones to attack merchant ships. The fact that a cheap drone can completely incapacitate a multi-hundred-million dollar vessel is the definition of asymmetric warfare. Ponder this: in order to nullify a $2,000 drone, the US must launch a missile costing $2.1 million. Even if the Houthis never hit a single target, every drone they send costs the US 1,000 times more to defend. Mathematically, this is an unwinnable war for the US.\nThe cost of using expensive naval missiles ‚Äî which can run up to $2.1 million a shot ‚Äî to destroy unsophisticated Houthi drones ‚Äî estimated at a few thousand dollars each ‚Äî is a growing concern, according to three other DOD [Department of Defense] officials.\n‚Äì Politico¬†\nGiven that the US is responsible for global maritime security due to its role as the global reserve currency issuer, the entire world is looking at how Pax Americana deals with this flagrant military bitch slap. Taking the Houthis‚Äô statements at face value, if the US broke off relations with Israel and forced Bibi to end the war, the Houthis would cease their attacks. However, even if the US believed Bibi was a genocidal madman, the empire could not be seen to ditch its ally because a government of a ‚Äúshithole‚Äù country launched a few cheap drones and shut down one of the most essential waterways in the globe.\nEven if Biden loudly calls on Bibi to wind up the war and stop murdering so many Gaza men, women, and children, Biden will never pull the financial and military plug on the Israelis for fear of losing face. The result is that the entire world gets a front-row seat to the future of warfare. The conventional US Navy, represented by aircraft carrier groups that cost trillions to float, is going head-to-head against sand people, launching drones that cost less than your bar tab at Zero Bond.\nI predict that we will witness just how difficult it is for the mighty Red, White, and Blue fist to swat a drone swarm of flies. For shipping companies to feel confident sailing through the Red Sea again, the US Navy must be perfect in every engagement. Every single drone must be neutralised. Because even one direct hit with a drone‚Äôs payload could incapacitate a commercial vessel. Additionally, because the US is now at war with the Yemen Houthis, shipping insurance premiums will skyrocket, making it even more uneconomical to sail through the Red Sea.\nDue to weather and geopolitics, higher shipping costs could cause a surge in inflation in the third and fourth quarter of this year. As Powell is undoubtedly aware of these issues, he will do everything he can to talk a big game about rate cuts without having to actually cut them. What might be a mild increase in the rate of inflation due to increased shipping costs could be supercharged by rate cuts and the resumption of QE. The market doesn‚Äôt appreciate this fact yet, but Bitcoin does.\nThe only thing that trumps fighting inflation is a financial crisis. That is why, to get the cuts, QT taper, and the possible resumption of QE the market believes is already in the bag come March, we first need a few banks to fail when the BTFP is not renewed.\nTactical Trading\nA 30% correction from the ETF approval high of $48,000 is $33,600. Therefore, I believe Bitcoin forms support between $30,0000 to $35,000. That is why I purchased 29 March 2024 $35,000 strike puts. I also dumped my trading positions in Solana and Bonk at a slight loss.\nBitcoin and crypto in general are the last freely traded markets globally. As such, they will anticipate changes in dollar liquidity before the manipulated TradFi fiat stock and bond markets. Bitcoin is telling us to look for Yellen and not Talkin‚Äô.\nYellen has a chance to add more juice to the markets in the upcoming QRA, published on January 31st. If she telegraphs that she will run down the TGA from $750 billion to zero, then we know there is another source of liquidity the market hadn‚Äôt anticipated that will prop up markets. The question then becomes: will it be enough to forestall any bank failures once the BTFP is not renewed?\nI believe the BTFP will not be renewed because neither Yellen nor Powell has mentioned it once. Therefore, the natural assumption is that it will expire, and the banks must pay back the almost $200 billion borrowed.

        "content": "Following the SEC decision on Bitcoin ETFs and the launch of the market on January 11, the race between asset managers continues to heat up. Invesco, a leading global provider of ETFs, in partnership with Galaxy Asset Management, launched the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO). This move was intended to offer efficient exposure to spot Bitcoin‚Äîa different approach to other Bitcoin ETF issuers.\nTo capture a greater share of the Bitcoin ETF market and climb up the ladder‚Äîcurrently ranked 6th‚ÄîInvesco and Galaxy said on Monday that they are cutting the sponsor fee. The fund‚Äôs fee will be slashed from 0.39% to 0.25%, putting it on par with most rivals.\nAt the same time, altcoins sharing the spotlight are Immutable (IMX) and InQubeta (QUBE). These top altcoins have been stirring up quite a buzz thanks to their staggering upside potential. Poised to skyrocket, these are the best cryptos to buy now and altcoins plays not to miss out on.\nInQubeta (QUBE): aiming for a surge after launch\nInQubeta (QUBE) is one of the new ICOs quickly gaining investors‚Äô confidence. For starters, it is one of the most bullish narratives, standing at the intersection of AI and blockchain. Additionally, other token features like deflationary tokenomics, governance, and staking further make it stand out.\nGiven the above, the presale selling outcomes as no surprise. To date, an astounding $8.6 million has been raised in early funding, with the $10 million fundraising milestone eyed next. In the seventh stage of the ICO, a token costs only $0.0224, and analysts tip it for a 6,000% rally after launch.\nPositioned as the best new crypto to invest in, other appeals of InQubeta involve the role it is designed to play. It aims to primarily address the fundraising challenge within the burgeoning AI sector. To this end, it will build the first crowdfunding platform that will allow tech startups to raise funds through crypto on its NFT marketplace.\n\n\nInvesco and Galaxy reduce Bitcoin ETF fee\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs continue to be the talk of the financial town‚Äîa buzz not likely to recede anytime soon. Investor sentiment post BTC ETF has also been on the rise as the market soars, with asset managers competing to get a significant slice.\nA piece of exciting news that is stirring up quite a buzz is Invesco and Galaxy deciding to cut the sponsor fee on their Bitcoin ETF, BTCO. On Monday, they announced reducing their fund‚Äôs fee from 0.39% to 0.25%, which will put BTCO on par with most rivals.\nThis move came on the back of the desire to gain a competitive edge. Currently, the spot Bitcoin ETF market is dominated by BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, with Invesco and Galaxy‚Äôs ETF product ranking 6th. Hence, this new rate might see BTCO rank higher, presently boasting about $280 million in trading volume and assets under management (AUM).\nImmutable (IMX): a solid altcoin to watch out for\nImmutable (IMX) is the first layer-2 scaling solution for NFTs on Ethereum. With this, it has been able to carve out a niche and become a pioneer in the dynamic crypto landscape. As a layer-2 scaling solution, it addresses Ethereum‚Äôs limitations like illiquidity, low scalability, and poor user experience, among others.\nOne of its competitive advantages is its massive scalability and zero gas fees for minting and trading NFTs. Remarkably, it does this without compromising asset or user security. Given this, Immutable¬†is primed for massive adoption and staggering growth.\nIn light of the above, it is clear why Immutable is one of the altcoins to watch for significant growth. Hence, if you wish to position yourself for substantial gains, IMX is among the best altcoins to invest in.\nConclusion\nInvesco and Galaxy have decided to reduce their Bitcoin ETF fee from 0.39% to 0.25% as competition heats up.¬†\nMeanwhile, aiming to skyrocket are Immutable and InQubeta, making them altcoins to watch and investors‚Äô favourites.\nFor more information about the InQubeta presale, visit the InQubeta Presale or join the InQubeta Communities.\nThe post Immutable and InQubeta altcoins to watch; Invesco and Galaxy slash fee in Spot Bitcoin ETF race appeared first on CoinJournal.",

        "content": "Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently made headlines with a significant burn of $7 million worth of Ether (ETH). This monumental burn, involving 3,219.96 Ether, underscores Ethereum‚Äôs transition towards becoming a deflationary currency.¬†\nLet‚Äôs delve into the details of this burn and its implications for the Ethereum network.\nUnderstanding Ethereum‚Äôs burn mechanism\nThe concept of burning in the cryptocurrency realm refers to the process of permanently removing coins or tokens from circulation by sending them to an unusable wallet. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, this burn occurred as a result of transactions, where a variable base fee, introduced through Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1159 (EIP-1159), is now included in each transaction.\nEIP-1159, implemented on August 5th, 2021, overhauled Ethereum‚Äôs fee model by introducing this variable base fee. This fee adjusts according to the current demand for block space and is subsequently burned, reducing the overall supply of Ether in circulation.\nEthereum‚Äôs transition to deflationary currency\nBefore implementing EIP-1159, Ethereum issued a new Ether at a rate of 4% per year. However, with the introduction of this upgrade, the burn mechanism has the potential to outpace the issuance of new Ether, leading to a decrease in the overall supply of ETH. This gradual reduction in supply positions Ethereum to potentially become a deflationary currency in the long run.\nExperts anticipate that as Ethereum continues its transition to Ethereum 2.0, which is expected to reduce the issuance rate of new Ether to around 0.5-1% per year, the burn rate could surpass the token‚Äôs issuance. This scenario would further solidify Ethereum‚Äôs status as a deflationary asset, potentially impacting its long-term value and market dynamics.\nRebel Satoshi emerges as a promising contender\nAmidst Ethereum‚Äôs significant burn event, attention turns to emerging cryptocurrencies poised to capitalize on market trends and investor sentiment. Rebel Satoshi (RBLZ) has garnered attention as a promising contender in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape, particularly in the realm of meme coins and as a potential alternative to Dogecoin.\nRebel Satoshi, built on the Ethereum network, distinguishes itself with a unique value proposition that resonates with investors seeking alternative meme coins with growth potential. Rebel Satoshi has demonstrated early investor confidence and support with a presale that has already sold over 100 million RBLZ and raised over $1.5 million.\nWhy invest in Rebel Satoshi?\nRebel Satoshi presents a compelling investment opportunity for crypto enthusiasts looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on emerging trends in the cryptocurrency market.¬†\nWith a presale approaching $2 million and built on the Ethereum network, known for its robust security and reliability, Rebel Satoshi stands out as a compelling choice for those seeking the best meme coin to invest in.\nFinal thoughts\nAs Ethereum continues its journey towards becoming a deflationary currency, investors are presented with unique opportunities to explore emerging cryptocurrencies like Rebel Satoshi. With its innovative approach and strong foundation on the Ethereum network, Rebel Satoshi offers investors a chance to participate in the evolving crypto market and potentially reap substantial rewards.\nIn conclusion, Ethereum‚Äôs $7 million burn signals a significant shift in its economic model; while Rebel Satoshi emerges as a promising project for those keen on¬†what altcoins to buy. Rebel Satoshi presents robust security and reliability, offering investors an exciting avenue for potential growth and investment opportunities. This is why top crypto analysts regard it as the best meme coin.\nFor the latest updates and more information, visit the official Rebel Satoshi Presale Website or contact Rebel Red via Telegram.\nThe post Ethereum‚Äôs significant $7M burn; new memecoin identified as promising Dogecoin contender appeared first on CoinJournal.",

        "content": "\nNuggetRush has emerged as a new favourite, edging past SHIB and BONK.\nBonk has seemingly peaked, while Shiba Inu has little room for growth.\nNuggetRush, an emerging P2E meme coin, is tipped for a 7,000% rally after its launch.\n\nMemecoins aren‚Äôt only a vital part of the crypto landscape but also one of the most promising sectors. As such, investors are always riding its intensely volatile wave, seeking staggering gains.¬†\nWith rags-to-riches stories common within this niche, enthusiasts have been overlooking Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) for NuggetRush (NUGX), a new P2E memecoin. As a top ICO, it boasts staggering upside potential, positioning it as one of the best altcoins to invest in today.\nNuggetRush (NUGX): outperforming Bonk and Shiba Inu\nNuggetRush (NUGX) has emerged as a top pick among meme enthusiasts and investors. It combines the best features of memes and adds them to gaming, contributing to its strong appeal. As a result, the presale has been stirring up quite a buzz, selling out fast.\nWhile it integrates memetic features, it is more than just a meme‚Äîit is a P2E memecoin. This makes it stand out from the typical cat coins or dog coins in the meme ecosystem. Hence, it has been hailed as the best new crypto to invest in now.¬†\nAs a P2E token, one of its real-world applications will include being the in-game currency. It will also be used to mint NFTs on the marketplace, along with being the governance token.\nThe P2E game, which will be built around gold mining, will involve players going on exciting quests. Gamers will have to create a mining team, which can either consist of other players or select in-game characters that double as NFT collectibles. Interestingly, NFTs can be staked with up to a 20% APY.\nThe ICO is in round 5, and a token costs only $0.018. Yet to launch, you can become an early adopter and position yourself for staggering gains. According to experts, it will experience a 7,000% rally after its launch, likely surpassing Shiba Inu and Bonk. To partake in the presale, click the link below.\nShiba Inu (SHIB): low upside potential\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the market‚Äôs top altcoins. It is currently the second-most popular meme coin, behind Dogecoin (DOGE). Its appeal primarily lies in its blend of memes and utility, placing it among the list of meme coins with potential.\nThis is evident in its thriving ecosystem, which houses utility-backed projects like Shibarium and ShibaSwap. Further, Shiba Inu‚Äôs token burn mechanism‚Äîwhich reduces supply‚Äîis another appeal.\nHowever, despite this, investors have been overlooking Shiba Inu due to its low growth potential. As one of the top crypto coins, its room for growth pales in comparison to newer and more promising narratives or meme coins.\nBonk (BONK): at its peak\nBonk¬†(BONK) was the talk of the crypto town last year. Several rags-to-riches stories were recounted, with many crypto millionaires created. If you had held the Solana-based dog-inspired token in 2023, you would have likely seen astounding gains.\nHowever, since its bull run the previous year, it hasn‚Äôt been all sunshine and rainbows. According to analysts, Bonk¬†has peaked, meaning it will likely decline rather than rally. With newer and shinier meme coins emerging, there has been a shift in sentiment, with many overlooking it.\nIts low upside potential means it isn‚Äôt as compelling as it used to be. Nevertheless, if you are seeking considerable gains, Bonk¬†is still a good crypto to buy.\nConclusion\nThe explosive growth potential of NuggetRush has seen it become a fan favourite among investors and enthusiasts at the expense of Shiba Inu and Bonk. Poised to skyrocket, you can position yourself now in anticipation of its surge.

        "content": "\nSports gambling has seen rapid expansion in the US since the 2018 Supreme Court ruling allowing states to regulate sports betting within their respective borders.\nAmong the states best known for casinos in the US is Nevada, home to the famous Las Vegas city.\nOutside of the US, Macau is another destination witnessing a surge in sports betting activities.\n\nNevada and Macau, two global gaming powerhouses, have recently released their gaming revenue reports, showcasing notable trends in the industry. Nevada witnessed record-breaking figures for both December 2023 and the full fiscal year, while Macau experienced a significant surge in January.\nFrom a groundbreaking Supreme Court ruling legalizing online casinos to the popularity of slots for real money, Nevada has emerged as a powerhouse in the realm of traditional casinos and online casinos including crypto casinos.\nNevada‚Äôs record gaming revenue\nIn December 2023, Nevada achieved a historic milestone with a record-breaking revenue of $1.43 billion, marking a 9.04% increase compared to the previous year.\nThe state‚Äôs gaming industry continued its upward trajectory throughout the fiscal year 2023, culminating in a new statewide revenue record of $15.5 billion. Slot machines remained the primary revenue driver, accounting for $10.3 billion in gaming revenue. However, table, counter, and card games saw a notable growth of 8.35%, outpacing the slot machine revenue increase.\nOn the regional front, Clark County experienced a substantial 9.75% increase in gaming revenue, reaching $1.27 billion while Washoe County witnessed a slight decline of 2.87%, amounting to $80.4 million. Notably, Elko County stood out with a remarkable 14.96% increase, reaching $36.4 million in gaming revenue for 2023.\nThese regional variations reflect the diverse dynamics within Nevada‚Äôs gaming landscape as the gaming industry continues to thrive in the ‚ÄòSilver State‚Äô, setting new benchmarks and attracting visitors from around the world.\nMacau‚Äôs impressive growth\nOutside Nevada and the United States, Macau, often referred to as the ‚ÄúLas Vegas of the East‚Äù for being a prominent gaming destination in Asia, reported a staggering 67% increase in gaming revenue for January 2024 compared to the previous year.\nThis surge highlights the resilience and recovery of Macau‚Äôs gaming sector following challenges posed by the pandemic. The positive momentum in Macau‚Äôs gaming industry bodes well for its future prospects and contributes to the global gaming market‚Äôs vibrancy.\nThe post Nevada sports betting revenue hit $1.43B in 2023; Macau sees surge in January appeared first on CoinJournal.",

The recent market-wide dropoff has also affected Chainlink (LINK).\nInvestors are now turning to¬†NuggetRush (NUGX) after its presale raised over $2 million. The mining adventure game packs several ways to earn real money. Yet, can NuggetRush (NUGX) join the top crypto coins in the gaming industry? Let‚Äôs find out.\nNuggetRush crosses established P2E boundaries with rising presale\nNuggetRush (NUGX)¬†is the¬†latest blockchain game¬†to pique the interest of P2E gamers and cryptocurrency investors across the globe. The project will launch the first-ever blockchain game that promises an¬†immersive mining experience¬†and real-world financial rewards.\nNuggetRush (NUGX)¬†centres around a realistic mining adventure where players¬†employ skilled miners and efficient machinery¬†to earn valuable financial rewards. The gameplay involves building a mining team, recruiting better workers, surveying lands, buying machinery, and completing mining missions.\nPlayers can collaborate to enjoy a multiplayer experience, earning extra NFT gaming rewards by joining mining partnerships and completing group tasks.¬†\nBesides¬†NuggetRush‚Äôs¬†(NUGX)¬†enjoyable gaming experience, the project provides an exciting financial opportunity for players and investors. On one hand, players can¬†trade their NFTs¬†for real gold in the game‚Äôs marketplace. On the other hand, players can¬†stake their NuggetRush NFTs¬†to receive a 20% APY.\nIn addition, the NUGX token presents a high-value asset for careful investors. NUGX‚Äôs value has risen by 80% from $0.010 in round one to $0.018 by round five of its presale. It has already sold nearly 167 million NUGX tokens. The project‚Äôs blockchain ICO is ending soon, and NUGX will be listed shortly after. However, many investors are more excited about its 11.1% price jump to $0.020.¬†\nFor more information about NUGX, visit the NuggetRush Presale Website.\nCelestia losses grow amid high staking activity\nCelestia‚Äôs (TIA) bullish momentum has dropped slightly despite being one of the top altcoins in the market since November 2023. After launching its mainnet services on October 31, 2023, Celestia (TIA) entered a bull run that lasted till the end of January 2024.¬†\nHowever, Celestia‚Äôs¬†price momentum has fallen¬†in the past week. TIA traded at $13.98 on January 1. Two weeks later, TIA rose by 36.1% to $19.03 on January 15. TIA then fell to $16.82 on January 21 before recovering by 10.4% to $17.05 by January 27.\nCelestia‚Äôs (TIA) fall stunned investors as its network activity and coin staking remained high in January. Several investors increased the staking of Celestia tokens as new networks offered airdrops to TIA stakers.¬†\nDespite the fall, analysts say Celestia (TIA) will recover due to¬†its recent partnership¬†with Polkadot and Arbitrum. These partnerships could increase Celestia‚Äôs network activity, thus pushing TIA up by 13.4% to $19.35.\nChainlink falls amid market-wide drop-off\nDecember 2023 was a very bullish month for altcoins like Chainlink (LINK). Interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs was very high, causing an increase in Chainlink‚Äôs trading activity. Data from CoinMarketCap showed that Chainlink‚Äôs market capitalization had grown from $4 billion to $9 billion between October to December 2023.¬†\nHowever, Chainlink‚Äôs (LINK) bullish momentum trailed off significantly in January. LINK sold at $15.54 on January 1. It fell by 11.7% to $13.71 on January 9. LINK recovered by 14.7% to $15.73 on January 17 before falling by 8.8% to $14.34 on January 27.\nChainlink‚Äôs (LINK) drop-off coincided with the recent market downturn. Bitcoin had fallen below $40,000 in the third week of January, causing a fall in trading activity for many altcoins. As a result, Chainlink‚Äôs market capitalization has fallen by $1.3 billion in January 2024. If Chainlink remains on its bearish trajectory, LINK could fall by 16.0% to $12.04.\nThe post Investors turn to NuggetRush presale as Chainlink and Celestia face downturns appeared first on CoinJournal.",

        "content": "Google‚Äôs recent decision to allow selected cryptocurrency finance products in its advertising space is pivotal, signalling potential shifts in investor behaviour and market dynamics. Along with this groundbreaking move is another development that has captured the attention of the crypto community.¬†\nThe token presale of Galaxy Fox ‚Äì considered by many to be the best upcoming ICO ‚Äì has surged past the $3 million mark, indicating growing interest in this promising project.\nGoogle launches crypto ads\nGoogle has recently altered its policies, allowing selected cryptocurrency finance products to be showcased in sponsored links and ads on its platform. This shift is particularly significant as it permits third parties targeting the US market to advertise financial products related to trading shares in trusts holding substantial pools of digital currency, such as the recently approved Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) products.\nThis change in Google‚Äôs advertising policies has opened the floodgates for companies like BlackRock and VanEck to feature sponsored links and ads, enticing users to invest in their Bitcoin ETFs. While this is undoubtedly a positive development for certain sectors within the crypto space, it‚Äôs crucial to note that not all cryptocurrency-related ads are allowed.\nNFT and cryptocurrency sales-related ads, including those for DeFi protocols and initial coin offerings (ICO), remain banned on the platform. Google continues to stand firm against advertisements promoting the trade, sale, and purchase of cryptocurrencies and those for games involving gambling or wagering with non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nGalaxy Fox: soaring beyond expectations\nGalaxy Fox has emerged as a beacon of resilience and success amid market fluctuations and uncertainties. Its ICO has catapulted past the $3 million mark in its presale, setting the stage for an exciting journey ahead. The presale is in Stage 7, with $GFOX priced at $0.00198. So far, over 2.5 billion tokens are already in the hands of early investors.\nThe presale‚Äôs success can be attributed to Galaxy Fox‚Äôs innovative approach, combining the best features of meme coins and traditional cryptocurrencies. With a deflationary tokenomics model, $GFOX incorporates a token burn mechanism that permanently removes tokens from circulation, contributing to its deflationary nature. Furthermore, the taxation system supports diverse mechanisms, channelling funds into ecosystem expansion via staking payouts and Treasury.\nGalaxy Fox‚Äôs hybrid model blends the best elements from the meme coin genre, creating a unique asset that stands out in the crowded crypto landscape. The deflationary nature of $GFOX positions it favourably for the forecasted excellent performance of deflationary assets in 2024. This characteristic makes it a compelling answer to this question: What crypto should I buy today?\nMoreover, Galaxy Fox offers passive income opportunities through staking rewards, appealing to investors looking to enhance their earnings. Combining a declining token supply and staking rewards creates an asset with a unique yield, making $GFOX an attractive option in the crypto market.\nGalaxy Fox doesn‚Äôt stop at being a financial asset. It also ventures into the entertainment realm with its Web3 Endless Runner game. This game leverages the play-to-earn (P2E) mechanic, providing users with an entertaining experience while offering another avenue for earning within the ecosystem. As history indicates, presales often thrive in bullish markets, and Galaxy Fox firmly establishes itself among the top cryptocurrencies to consider in the current market conditions.\n\nConclusion\nAmidst Google‚Äôs groundbreaking shift in crypto advertising policies, Galaxy Fox‚Äôs ascent past $3 million in its presale is a testament to the innovation and resilience within the cryptocurrency space. As the market continues to evolve, discerning investors seeking the best crypto presale could consider watching the trajectory of $GFOX.\nGalaxy Fox presents itself as a compelling option for those pondering the perennial question of ‚ÄúWhat crypto should I buy?‚Äù To delve deeper into this celestial journey, consider visiting Galaxy Fox‚Äôs official site or joining their community via Telegram.\nTo learn more about $GFOX, visit Galaxy Fox Presale or join the Community.\nThe post Google launches crypto ads as market heats up; GFOX presale rockets past $3M appeared first on CoinJournal.",

The increase in the value of Mina makes it the best crypto to buy for massive gains.\nHowever, it is essential to review the predictions before investing in Mina. The future price predictions are also optimistic for Mina.

The long-awaited implementation will enable users to send and receive ADA between Cardano and Ergo.¬†\nDespite the positive news, Cardano‚Äôs native token, ADA, decreased in value. ADA lost 3.9% of its value and dropped from $0.5095 to $0.4895 in three weeks. Despite the decrease, crypto analysts are hopeful about the future of Cardano and ADA.¬†\nAccording to Cardano‚Äôs price prediction, ADA can¬†improve by 53.1% by 2024. In the case of a bullish scenario, Cardano will be trading at the maximum predicted price of $0.9102 per ADA by the end of 2024.\nHowever, the price of ADA¬†will be affected negatively if the market turns bearish.

This approach reflects the findings of a study by Genoverband, which indicates significant interest among banks in providing cryptocurrency solutions.\nThe initial plan involved partnering with DWP Bank for the cryptocurrency trading pilot, although there are speculations that new partners could join the venture.\nDZ Bank‚Äôs foray into cryptocurrency trading follows its release of a cryptocurrency custody platform in November leveraging Ripple‚Äôs technology solution to offer secure storage and processing of digital assets. DZ Bank had previously announced its partnership with Swiss custody tech firm Metaco before it was acquired by Ripple.\nWhile the bank awaits a crypto custody license from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), its collaboration with Metaco demonstrates a strategic approach to navigating regulatory requirements while innovating in the digital asset space.\nMoreover, DZ Bank‚Äôs move to roll out a crypto trading pilot program comes at a time when institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is on the rise globally.
